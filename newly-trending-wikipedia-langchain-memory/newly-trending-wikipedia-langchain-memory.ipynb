    "When I have run the trending analysis in my previous notebooks, I was seeing articles that related to each other, but one didn't have any new information present in the portion of the artcile I was passing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, Jeff Baena passed away. His article trended and his recent death was correctly identified as the reason. His wife, Aubrey Plaza, had her article trending as well. But the reason for her trending article was vague and did not recognize her husband's death as the reason.\n",

    "I am testing out Langchain's memory feature to try to solve this problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This current iteration filters out the articles that have already been trending. This makes for a more interesting list. I've also implemented a master HTML file that keeps track of every time this is run.\n",

    "- It's important to distiguish which problems are better solved with a function vs an LLM. My though right now is that the more structured data is, the more likely a static function is the answer."
