The championship begins in December and ends in January and has been held at [[Alexandra Palace]] in [[London]], since 2008. Organised by the [[Professional Darts Corporation]] (PDC), it is the most prestigious of their tournaments, with the winner receiving the Sid Waddell Trophy, named in honour of the darts commentator [[Sid Waddell]]. Along with the [[Premier League Darts]] and [[World Matchplay (darts)|World Matchplay]], it is part of the [[Professional Darts Corporation Triple Crown|Triple Crown]].\\n\\nThe PDC championship began in 1994 as the '''WDC World Darts Championship''' as one of the consequences of the [[split in darts]], which saw the [[World Darts Council]] break away from the BDO. As a result of the settlement between the BDO and the WDC in 1997, the WDC became the PDC, and players were then free to choose which world championship to enter (but not both in the same year), as long as they met certain eligibility criteria. Both organisations continued to organize their own world championship until the 2020 editions, after which the BDO folded.\\n\\nThere have been thirteen different winners since the tournament's inception. With 14 wins from 25 appearances, [[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]] dominated the competition until last winning it in 2013. Other players to win more than once are [[John Part]] (2003 & 2008), [[Adrian Lewis]] (2011 & 2012), [[Gary Anderson (darts player)|Gary Anderson]] (2015 & 2016), [[Michael van Gerwen]] (2014, 2017 & 2019) and [[Peter Wright (darts player)|Peter Wright]] (2020 & 2022). The one-time winners are the inaugural champion [[Dennis Priestley]] (1994), [[Raymond van Barneveld]] (2007), [[Rob Cross (darts player)|Rob Cross]] (2018), [[Gerwyn Price]] (2021), [[Michael Smith (darts player) | Michael Smith]] (2023), [[Luke Humphries]] (2024) and [[Luke Littler]] (2025).\\n\\n==History==\\n[[File:2009_World_Darts_Championship.jpg|thumb|right|A match between [[Mensur Suljoviƒá]] and [[Kevin Painter]] at the [[2010 PDC World Darts Championship|2010 championship]]]]\\nIn 1992, [[1994 PDC World Darts Championship#The 16 Defectors|some high-profile players]], including all previous winners of the [[BDO World Darts Championship]] still active in the game, formed the WDC, and in 1994, held their first World Championship. [[Dennis Priestley]] won the inaugural competition.\\n\\nThe players who broke away were taking a significant gamble ‚Äì the tournament was broadcast on satellite television rather than terrestrial, and from 1994 to 2001, the prize fund for the players in the WDC/PDC World Championship was lower than the prize fund in the BDO version, although the 1997 PDC World Champion received ¬£45,000 compared to that year's BDO World Champion receiving ¬£38,000. In 2002, the PDC prize fund overtook that of the BDO for the first time, and the PDC event now boasts the largest prize fund of any darts competition. In 2010, the prize fund reached ¬£1 million for the first time, with the champion collecting ¬£200,000.\\n\\nThe 2014 and 2015 PDC world champions collected ¬£250,000 for their wins.
