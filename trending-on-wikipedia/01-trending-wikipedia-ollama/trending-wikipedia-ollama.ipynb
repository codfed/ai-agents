       "- Select one lesser-known film from this period with significant casting details such as the inclusion of a notable actor like Bill Skarsgård but not widely recognized outside supernatural horror circles, and craft an SEO-friendly Wikipedia article title. The goal here isn't to sensationalize or create hype inappropriately; rather aim for balanced informative content that respects the source material while making it accessible on English Wikipedia without relying excessively on promotional language of mainstream media outlets like IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, etc., which might not always provide complete and accurate data.\n",
       "- In less than 50 words within your generated article title or snippet section, introduce an interesting fact about the film's unique setting that is seldom mentioned in popular summaries but can intrigue readers familiar with supernatural horror films like Nosferatu. Avoid common tropes such as haunted houses and vampire mythology to ensure freshness of content while maintaining relevance within this niche genre.\n",
       "- Following the article title or snippet, create a list in bullet points summarizing just three key aspects that distinguish your chosen film from others in its subgenre—focusing on elements such as narrative structure, visual style, and thematic depth without overt references to established horror icons like Bram Stoker's Dracula. These should be unique attributes of the selected movie set apart within supernatural horror cinema up until 2024 that readers might not commonly know about or experience in other films, again providing an engaging yet informative touchstone for Wikipedia content regarding this lesser-known film and its place within the genre's landscape.\n",
