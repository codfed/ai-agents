President-elect [[Donald Trump]] announced on November{{nbsp}}12, 2024, that Hegseth would be his nominee to serve as [[United States Secretary of Defense]] in his [[second cabinet of Donald Trump|second cabinet]].\n\nAfter graduating from [[Princeton University]], Hegseth became an active figure in [[Conservatism|conservative]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politics. As a national guardsman, he served at [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantánamo Bay]] and in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]]. Since 2014, he has been a political commentator for [[Fox News]] and a weekend co-host of ''[[Fox & Friends]]'' from 2017 to 2024. He was previously the executive director of [[Vets for Freedom]] and [[Americans for Prosperity#Other policy advocacy|Concerned Veterans for America]].\n\nIn 2016, Hegseth emerged as a supporter of [[Donald Trump]]'s presidential candidacy, and he served as an occasional advisor to Trump throughout the latter's first term as president. Following Hegseth's encouragement, Trump pardoned three soldiers accused or convicted of [[war crime]]s in 2019. Hegseth was considered to lead the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] in the [[first Trump administration]], but [[David Shulkin]] was tapped instead. Hegseth holds strongly conservative views, and has been described as a [[Christian nationalism in the United States|Christian nationalist]]. \n\nAfter Trump announced his intention to nominate Hegseth as defense secretary, reports surfaced about his adultery, alleged sexual assault, financial mismanagement, and public drunkenness. \n\nHegseth has written books including ''[[American Crusade]]'' (2020) and ''[[The War on Warriors]]'' (2024).\n\n==Early life and education==\nHegseth was born on June 6, 1980, in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], the son of Brian, a basketball coach, and Penny Hegseth.<ref>{{Cite web |date=May 12, 2019 |title=Meet Pete Hegseth's parents! |url=https://www.foxnews.com/video/6035673148001 |access-date=November 14, 2024 |website=Fox News |language=en-US |archive-date=November 28, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241128102829/https://www.foxnews.com/video/6035673148001 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |",
