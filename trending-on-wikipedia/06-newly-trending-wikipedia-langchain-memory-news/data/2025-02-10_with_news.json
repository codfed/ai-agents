In code 404, the first digit indicates a client error, such as a mistyped [[Uniform Resource Locator]] (URL). The following two digits indicate the specific error encountered. HTTP's use of three-digit codes is similar to the use of such codes in earlier protocols such as [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] and [[Network News Transfer Protocol|NNTP]]. At the HTTP level, a 404 response code is followed by a human-readable \"reason phrase\". The HTTP specification suggests the phrase \"Not Found\"<ref name=\"section-654\" /> and many web servers by default issue an HTML page that includes both the 404 code and the \"Not Found\" phrase.\n\nA 404 error is often returned when pages have been moved or deleted. In the first case, it is better to employ [[URL mapping]] or [[URL redirection]] by returning a 301 Moved Permanently response, which can be configured in most server configuration files, or through [[URL rewriting]]; in the second case, a 410 Gone should be returned. Because these two options require special server configuration, most websites do not make use of them.\n\n404 errors should not be confused with [[Domain Name System|DNS]] errors, which appear when the given URL refers to a server name that does not exist. A 404 error indicates that the server itself was found, but that the server was not able to retrieve the requested page.\n\n==Soft 404 errors==\n{{anchor|Soft 404}}\n\nSome websites report a \"not found\" error by returning a standard web page with a \"200 OK\" response code, falsely reporting that the page loaded properly; this is known as a ''soft 404''. The term \"soft 404\" was introduced in 2004 by Ziv Bar-Yossef ''et al''.<ref>{{Cite book |author1=Ziv Bar-Yossef |author2=Andrei Z.

The team competes in the [[EFL Championship]], the second level of the [[English football league system]]. The club has played at [[Home Park]] since 1901.\n\nThe club takes its nickname, ''The Pilgrims'', from the Pilgrim Fathers, [[Pilgrim Fathers|an English religious group]], that left Plymouth for the [[New World]] in 1620. The club crest features the ''[[Mayflower]]'', the ship that carried the pilgrims to [[Massachusetts]]. The club has predominantly played in green and white throughout its history, with a few exceptions in the late 1960s and early 1970s when white was the colour of choice. A darker shade of green, described (by some) as ''Argyle green'', was adopted in the 2001–02 season, and has been used ever since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Plymouth_Argyle/Plymouth_Argyle.htm|title=Plymouth Argyle – Historical Football Kits|website=www.historicalkits.co.uk|access-date=14 August 2007|archive-date=17 August 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817021244/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Plymouth_Argyle/Plymouth_Argyle.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> The club has yet to compete in the [[Premier League]] or the [[Football League First Division]] that preceded it, the city of Plymouth being the largest in England to have never hosted a top-flight men's football team. Plymouth Argyle is the most southerly and westerly League club in England and the nation's only professional club named Argyle.\n\nOriginally founded simply as '''Argyle''' in 1886, the club turned professional and entered both the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] and [[Western Football League|Western League]] as '''Plymouth Argyle''' in 1903. The team won the Western League title in 1904–05 and the Southern League title in 1912–13, before winning election into the [[Football League Third Division]] in 1920. Finishing as runners-up on six consecutive occasions, Argyle eventually won promotion as [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] champions under the long-serving management of [[Bob Jack]] in 1929–30. A 20-year stay in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] ended in 1950, though the club returned again as Third Division South champions in 1951–52. After another relegation in 1956 Argyle again proved too strong for the third tier, winning the Third Division title not long after in 1958–59.\n\nArgyle were relegated from the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1968, 1977 and 1992, having won promotion out of the Third Division as runners-up in 1974–75 and 1985–86.
