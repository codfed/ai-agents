English longbowmen figure prominently in the foreground on the right, where they are driving away Italian [[mercenary]] [[crossbow]]men.]]\n\nThe '''English longbow''' was a powerful [[Middle Ages|medieval]] type of [[Bow and arrow|bow]], about {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}} long. While it is debated whether it originated in England or in Wales from the [[Welsh bow]], by the 14th century the [[longbow]] was being used by both the English and the Welsh as a weapon of war and for hunting. English longbows were effective against the French during the [[Hundred Years' War]], particularly in the battles of [[Battle of Sluys|Sluys]] (1340), [[Battle of Crécy|Crécy]] (1346), [[Battle of Poitiers|Poitiers]] (1356), and [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]] (1415). They were less successful later on, as longbowmen had their lines broken at the [[Battle of Verneuil]] (1424), although the English won a decisive victory there; they were completely routed at the [[Battle of Patay]] (1429) when they were charged by the French mounted men-at-arms before they had prepared the terrain and finished defensive arrangements. The [[Battle of Pontvallain]] (1370) had also previously shown longbowmen were not particularly effective when not given the time to set up defensive positions.\n\nNo English longbows survive from the period when the longbow was dominant (c. 1250–1450),{{sfn|Kaiser|1980}} probably because bows became weaker, broke, and were replaced rather than being handed down through generations.<ref>{{harvnb|Levick|1992}}</ref> More than 130 bows survive from the [[Renaissance]] period, however. More than 3,500 arrows and 137 whole longbows were recovered from the ''[[Mary Rose]]'', a ship of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s navy that sank at [[Portsmouth]] in 1545.\n\n== Description ==\n\n=== Length ===\n\nA longbow must be long enough to allow its user to [[bow draw|draw]] the string to a point on the face or body, and the length therefore varies with the user. In continental Europe it was generally seen as any bow longer than {{convert|1.2|m|ftin|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] says it is of {{convert|5|to|6|ft|m|abbr=off}} in length.<ref>{{harvnb|Kaiser|1980}} footnote 5, citing \"The Berkhamsted Bow\", Antiquaries Journal 11 (London), p. 423</ref> Richard Bartelot, of the [[Royal Artillery Institution]], said that the bow was of yew, {{convert|6|ft|m}} long, with a {{convert|3|ft|mm|adj=on}} arrow.<ref>{{harvnb|Kaiser|1980}} footnote 6, citing Major Richard G. Bartelot, Assistant Historical Secretary, Royal Artillery Institution, Old Military Academy, Woolwich, England. Letter, 16 February 1976</ref> [[Gaston III, Count of Foix]], wrote in 1388 that a longbow should be \"of yew or [[Buxus|boxwood]], seventy inches ({{convert|70|in|m|disp=output only}}) between the points of attachment for the cord\".{{sfn|Longman|Walrond|1967|p=132}} Historian [[Jim Bradbury]] said they were an average of about {{convert|5|ft|8|in|m}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Bradbury|1985|loc=|p=75}} </ref> All but the last estimate were made before the excavation of the ''Mary Rose'', where bows were found ranging in length from {{convert|1.87|to|2.11|m|ftin|abbr=on|order=flip}} with an average length of {{convert|1.98|m|ftin|abbr=on|order=flip}}.{{sfn|Staff|2007|p=6}}\n\n=== Draw weights ===\nEstimates for the draw of these bows varies considerably. Before the recovery of the ''Mary Rose'', Count M. Mildmay Stayner, Recorder of the British Long Bow Society, estimated the bows of the Medieval period drew {{convert|90|–|110|lb-f|N|lk=on|abbr=off}}, maximum, and W. F. Paterson, Chairman of the Society of Archer-Antiquaries, believed the weapon had a supreme draw weight of only {{convert|80|–|90|lb-f|N|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Kaiser|1980}} Other sources suggest significantly higher draw weights. The original draw forces of examples from the ''Mary Rose'' are estimated by [[Robert Hardy]] at {{convert|150|–|160|lb-f|N|abbr=on}} at a {{convert|30|in|cm|1|adj=on}} draw length; the full range of draw weights was between {{convert|100|–|185|lb-f|N|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Strickland-17>{{harvnb|Strickland|Hardy|2005|p=17}}</ref> The {{convert|30|in|cm|1|adj=on}} draw length was used because that is the length allowed by the arrows commonly found on the ''Mary Rose''.\n\nA modern longbow's draw is typically {{convert|60|lb-f|N|abbr=on}} or less, and by modern convention measured at {{convert|28|in|cm|1|}}. Historically, hunting bows usually had draw weights of {{convert|50|–|60|lb-f|N|abbr=on}}, which is enough for all but the very largest game and which most ",
