Soon after its release in Brazilian theaters on 7 November 2024 by Sony Pictures Releasing International, the film was the target of an unsuccessful boycott by the Brazilian far-right.

Rogue waves do not appear to have a single distinct cause but occur where physical factors such as high winds and strong currents cause waves to merge to create a single large wave.<ref name=\"Econ1\"/> Recent research suggests [[sea state]] crest-trough correlation leading to linear [[Superposition principle|superposition]] may be a dominant factor in predicting the frequency of rogue waves.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Häfner |first1=Dion |last2=Gemmrich |first2=Johannes |last3=Jochum |first3=Markus |title=Machine-guided discovery of a real-world rogue wave model |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=20 November 2023 |volume=120 |issue=48 |pages=e2306275120 |doi=10.1073/pnas.2306275120 |doi-access=free |pmid=37983488 |pmc=10691345 |arxiv=2311.12579 |bibcode=2023PNAS..12006275H }}</ref>\n\nAmong other causes, studies of [[non-linear system|nonlinear]] waves such as the [[Peregrine soliton]], and waves modeled by the [[nonlinear Schrödinger equation]] (NLS), suggest that [[modulational instability]] can create an unusual [[sea state]] where a \"normal\" wave begins to draw energy from other nearby waves, and briefly becomes very large. Such phenomena are not limited to water and are also studied in liquid helium, nonlinear optics, and microwave cavities. A 2012 study reported that in addition to the Peregrine soliton reaching up to about three times the height of the surrounding sea, a hierarchy of higher order wave solutions could also exist having progressively larger sizes and demonstrated the creation of a \"super rogue wave\" (a [[breather]] around five times higher than surrounding waves) in a [[Wave tank|water-wave tank]].<ref name=super>{{cite journal |last1=Chabchoub |first1=A. |last2=Hoffmann |first2=N. |last3=Onorato |first3=M. |last4=Akhmediev |first4=N. |title=Super Rogue Waves: Observation of a Higher-Order Breather in Water Waves |url=https://www.proquest.com/openview/6e84fa9d48494ef57c4a54ad8a6c8ca6 |journal=Physical Review X |date=29 March 2012 |volume=2 |issue=1 |page=011015 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevX.2.011015|bibcode=2012PhRvX...2a1015C |hdl=1885/67997 |hdl-access=free }}</ref>\n\nA 2012 study supported the existence of oceanic rogue holes, the inverse of rogue waves, where the depth of the hole can reach more than twice the significant wave height.<ref name=\"MyUser_Onlinelibrary.wiley.com_April_16_2016c\"/> Although it is often claimed that rogue holes have never been observed in nature despite replication in wave tank experiments, there is a rogue hole recording from an oil platform in the North Sea, revealed in Kharif et al.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-88419-4 | doi=10.1007/978-3-540-88419-4 | title=Rogue Waves in the Ocean | series=Advances in Geophysical and Environmental Mechanics and Mathematics | date=2009 | isbn=978-3-540-88418-7 }}</ref> The same source also reveals a recording of what is known as the 'Three Sisters'.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Tsunami by hokusai 19th century.jpg|thumb|right|Although commonly described as a [[tsunami]], the titular wave in ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'' by [[Hokusai]] is more likely an example of a large rogue wave.]]\nRogue waves are waves in open water that are much larger than surrounding waves.

He pleaded guilty to all 16 charges on 20 January 2025, when his trial was due to begin, having initially entered a not-guilty plea. On 23 January 2025, Rudakubana was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]], with a minimum term of 52 years. No motive for the stabbings was identified; the prosecution suggested that the motivation could have been \"the commission of mass murder as an end in itself\" and no evidence of terrorism was found.\n\nAfter Rudakubana's guilty pleas, it emerged that he had a history of violent and concerning behaviour and had been referred to the anti-extremism programme [[CONTEST#Prevent|Prevent]] three times between 2019 and 2021, but was not accepted into the scheme as no terrorist ideology was identified. Prime Minister [[Keir Starmer]] promised to overhaul terrorism laws to include non-ideological acts of violence, and appointed [[David Anderson, Baron Anderson of Ipswich|David Anderson]] to lead a review of the Prevent programme.\n\n== Background ==\n{{OSM Location map|coord={{coord|53.6424|-2.9854}}|zoom=13|width=300|height=260|float=right|minimap=file|mini-file=Merseyside UK relief location map.jpg|mini-width=100 <!-- All units for the mini-image are pixel units -->|mini-height=51 <!-- height and width need to match the dimensions of the image file -->|minipog-x=57 <!-- x and y co-ordinates are pixels numbered from a top-left origin -->|minipog-y=15  <!-- They optionally place a red dot to show location of the main map -->|scalemark=100  <!-- shifts the scalemark further to the left -->|label=Attack site|mark-coord={{coord|53.6424|-2.9854}}|label-pos=top|caption=Location of the Hart Space within Southport}}The Hart Space, where the attack occurred, was a [[Community centre|community studio venue]] on Hart Street in [[Meols Cop]], Southport, about a mile east of the town centre.
