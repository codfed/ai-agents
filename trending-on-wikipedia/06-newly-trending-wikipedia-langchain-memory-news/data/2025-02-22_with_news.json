Selected first overall by the Oilers in the [[2015 NHL entry draft]], McDavid is widely considered one of the best players in the world, and his offensive dominance has drawn comparisons to players such as [[Wayne Gretzky]].  \n\nMcDavid spent his childhood playing ice hockey against older children. Coached by his father, McDavid won four [[Ontario Minor Hockey Association]] championships with the York Simcoe Express, but he left the team in 2011 to join the [[Toronto Marlboros]] of the [[Greater Toronto Hockey League]] (GTHL). There, McDavid was named the GTHL Player of the Year and the winner of the [[Tim Adams Memorial Trophy]]. He was granted [[Canadian Hockey League#Exceptional player status|exceptional player status]] in 2012 by [[Hockey Canada]], which allowed him to begin playing [[junior ice hockey]] at the age of 15. The [[Erie Otters]] of the [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL) selected him first overall in that year's draft, and he played there until 2015. McDavid's OHL career concluded with a [[2014–15 OHL season|2014–15 season]] in which he recorded 120 [[Point (ice hockey)|points]] and received a number of OHL and [[Canadian Hockey League]] (CHL) awards, including the [[Red Tilson Trophy]], [[Wayne Gretzky 99 Award]], and [[CHL Player of the Year]] awards. McDavid also represented [[Canada men's national junior ice hockey team|Canada]] at several international competitions during this time, winning gold medals at the [[2013 IIHF World U18 Championships]] and [[2015 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]].\n\nAfter finishing his junior hockey career, McDavid joined the Oilers for their [[2015–16 NHL season|2015–16 season]]. Despite missing three months of his rookie season due to a fractured [[clavicle]], he was named to the [[NHL All-Rookie Team]] and was a finalist for the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]]. The following year, the Oilers appointed 19-year-old McDavid the youngest captain in NHL history. Recording 100 points during the [[2016–17 NHL season|2016–17 season]], at the age of 20, McDavid became the second youngest player to win the [[Art Ross Trophy]] for the leading scorer in the NHL. He was also awarded the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]], [[Ted Lindsay Award]], and was selected to the [[NHL All-Star team|NHL First All-Star Team]]. Although the Oilers missed the [[Stanley Cup]] playoffs during the next two seasons, McDavid scored 41 goals in consecutive years. He injured his knee in the final game of the [[2018–19 NHL season|2018–19 season]] but underwent a nonsurgical rehabilitation process that allowed him to return in time for the start of the [[2019–20 NHL season|2019–20 season]]. In [[2020–21 NHL season|2020–21]], despite the [[Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sports|COVID-19 pandemic]] shortening the NHL season to only 56 games, McDavid recorded 100 points for the fourth time in his career. In [[2023–24 NHL season|2023–24]], McDavid captained the Oilers to the [[2024 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]], their first since [[2006 Stanley Cup Finals|2006]]. McDavid went on to win the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as the most valuable player in the [[2024 Stanley Cup playoffs]], becoming only the sixth player, and first since [[Jean-Sébastien Giguère]] in [[2003 Stanley Cup Finals|2003]], to win the award despite not winning the Stanley Cup.\n\nHe is a four-time NHL First Team All-Star, a five-time recipient of the Art Ross Trophy, a four-time winner of the Ted Lindsay Award, a three-time recipient of the Hart Memorial Trophy, and the [[Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy]] winner for [[2022–23 NHL season|2022–23]] as the league's leading goal-scorer. His opponents have praised his speed on the ice, and McDavid has won Fastest Skater at the [[NHL All-Star Skills Competition]] four times. He is one of only two players{{snd}}after fellow Oilers captain Wayne Gretzky in [[1981–82",
