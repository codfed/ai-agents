She boarded at [[St Hilda's Anglican School for Girls]] and then briefly studied at the [[University of Sydney]], dropping out to work with her father at Hancock Prospecting. She was Lang Hancock's only child, and when he died in 1992 she succeeded him as executive chairwoman.\n\nRinehart oversaw an expansion of the company over the following decade, and due to the iron ore boom of the early 2000s became a nominal billionaire in 2006. In the 2010s, Rinehart began to expand her holdings into areas outside the mining industry. She made sizeable investments in [[Ten Network Holdings]] and [[Fairfax Media]] (although she sold her interest in the latter in 2015), and also expanded into agriculture, buying several [[cattle stations]], divesting them within a decade.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Schlesinger, Larry|date=23 September 2021|title=Gina Rinehart sells cattle stations for 100m|work=[[The Australian Financial Review]]|publisher=Nine Publishing|url=https://www.afr.com/property/commercial/gina-rinehart-sells-wa-cattle-stations-for-100m-20210923-p58u3z|url-access=subscription|access-date=19 May 2022|archive-date=19 May 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220519150203/https://www.afr.com/property/commercial/gina-rinehart-sells-wa-cattle-stations-for-100m-20210923-p58u3z|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nRinehart is Australia's richest person.

Rinehart's net worth dropped significantly over the following few years due to a slowdown in the Australian mining sector.
