The president can issue a full pardon, reversing a criminal conviction (along with its legal effects) as if it never happened. A pardon can also be offered for a period of time to cover any crimes that may have taken place or stop any charges from ever being filed during that period. A pardon can be issued from the time an offense is committed, and can even be issued after the full sentence has been served. The president can issue a reprieve, commuting a criminal sentence, lessening its severity, its duration, or both while leaving a record of the conviction in place. Additionally, the president can make a pardon conditional, or vacate a conviction while leaving parts of the sentence in place, like the payment of fines or restitution.<ref name=\"contop\"/><ref>{{cite web| last=Pfiffner| first=James| title=Essays on Article II:Pardon Power| work=The Heritage Guide to The Constitution| url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/2/essays/89/pardon-power| publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]]| location=Washington, D.C.| access-date=June 3, 2015}}</ref> After George W.

Under this legal interpretation, posthumous Presidential pardons appear to be merely ceremonial and have no effect, since they were never delivered to the recipient.\n\nPardons granted by presidents from [[George Washington]] until [[Grover Cleveland]]'s first term (1885–89) were handwritten by the president; thereafter, pardons were prepared for the president by administrative staff requiring only that the president sign it.<ref name=Clemency/> The records of these presidential acts were openly available for public inspection until 1934. In 1981, the [[Office of the Pardon Attorney]] was created and records from President [[George H. W. Bush]] forward are listed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.howstuffworks.com/presidential-pardon.htm |title=How Presidential Pardons Work |first=Josh |last=Clark |work=HowStuffWorks |date=August 9, 2007 |publisher=howstuffworks.com |access-date=August 27, 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{horizontal TOC|nonum=yes}}\n\n==Summary==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!width=20% | President\n!width=20% | Tenure\n!Pardons\n!class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n|-\n|data-sort-value=\"Washington, George\" | [[#George Washington|George Washington]] || 1789–1797 || 16 || \n|-\n|data-sort-value=\"Adams, John\" | [[#John Adams|John Adams]] || 1797–1801 || 20 || \n|-\n|data-sort-value=\"Jefferson, Thomas\" |[[#Thomas Jefferson|Thomas Jefferson]] || 1801–1809 || 119 || \n|-\n|data-sort-value=\"Madison, James\" |[[#James Madison|James Madison]] || 1809–1817 || 196 || \n|-\n|data-sort-value=\"Monroe, James\" |[[#James Monroe|James Monroe]] || 1817–1825 || 419 || \n|-\n|data-sort-value=\"Adams, John Quincy\" |[[#John Quincy Adams|John Quincy Adams]] || 1825–1829 || 183 || \n|-\n|data-sort-value=\"Jackson, Andrew\"|[[#Andrew Jackson|Andrew Jackson]] || 1829–1837 || 386 || \n|-\n|data-sort-value=\"Van Buren, Martin\"|[[#Martin Van Buren|Martin Van Buren]] || 1837–1841 || 168 || \n|-\n|data-sort-value=\"Harrison, William Henry\"|[[#William Henry Harrison|William Henry Harrison]] || 1841 || 0 || \n|-\n|data-sort-value=\"Tyler, John\"|[[#John Tyler|John Tyler]] || 1841–1845 || 209 || \n|-\n|data-sort-value=\"Polk,",

Its construction was one of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken. Since its inauguration on August 15, 1914, the canal has succeeded in shortening maritime communication in time and distance, invigorating maritime and economic transportation by providing a short and relatively inexpensive transit route between the two oceans, decisively influencing global trade patterns, boosting economic growth in developed and developing countries, as well as providing the basic impetus for economic expansion in many remote regions of the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pancanal.com/esp/general/asi-es-el-canal.html\n|title=Así es el Canal |access-date= 2 August 2009\n|author=Autoridad del Canal de Panamá |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090506173556/http://www.pancanal.com/esp/general/asi-es-el-canal.html\n|archive-date= 6 May 2009|quotation= Buques de todo el mundo transitan a diario a través del canal de Panamá.
