Starring [[Bill Murray]], [[Andie MacDowell]], and [[Chris Elliott]], it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual [[Groundhog Day]] event in [[Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania]], who becomes trapped in a [[time loop]], forcing him to relive February{{nbsp}}2 repeatedly. The film also features [[Stephen Tobolowsky]], [[Brian Doyle-Murray]], [[Marita Geraghty]], [[Angela Paton]], [[Rick Ducommun]], [[Rick Overton]], and [[Robin Duke]] in supporting roles.\n\nRubin conceived the outline of ''Groundhog Day'' in the early 1990s. He wrote it as a [[spec script]] to gain meetings with producers for other work. It eventually came to the attention of Ramis, who worked with Rubin to make his idea less dark in tone and more palatable to a general audience by enhancing the comedy. After being cast, Murray clashed with Ramis over the script; Murray wanted to focus on the philosophical elements, whereas Ramis concentrated on the comedic aspects. [[Principal photography]] took place from March to June 1992, almost entirely in [[Woodstock, Illinois]]. Filming was difficult, in part because of bitterly cold weather but also because of the ongoing conflict between Ramis and Murray.\n\n''Groundhog Day'' was a box-office success on its release, earning over $105{{nbsp}}million to become one of the highest-grossing films of 1993. It also received generally positive reviews. Reviewers were consistent in praise for the film's successful melding of highly sentimental and deeply cynical moments, and for the philosophical message beneath the comedy. It received multiple award nominations and won a [[BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay]]. For all its success, the film marked the end of Ramis's and Murray's long collaborative partnership, which had produced films like ''[[Caddyshack]]'' (1980) and ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984). After filming ended, the pair did not speak to each other until shortly before Ramis's death in 2014. The film was a showcase for Murray; he had previously been seen primarily as a comic actor, and his performance led to more serious roles in critically acclaimed films.\n\nIn the years since its release, the film has grown in esteem; it is often considered to be among the greatest films of the 1990s and one of the greatest comedy movies ever. It has also had a significant effect on popular culture: the term ''Groundhog Day'', meaning a monotonous, unpleasant, and repetitive situation, has become part of the English lexicon. [[Buddhist]], [[Christian]], and [[Jewish]] scholars have analyzed the film as a religious allegory. ''Groundhog Day'' is also credited with having ushered in mainstream acceptance of comedy films with fantasy-genre elements. In 2006, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. ''Groundhog Day'' was adapted into [[Groundhog Day (musical)|a 2016 musical]], and inspired a 2019 video game sequel, ''Groundhog Day: Like Father Like Son''.\n\n==Plot==\nOn February{{nbsp}}1, cynical television weatherman Phil Connors reassures his [[Pittsburgh]] viewers that an approaching blizzard will miss [[Western Pennsylvania]]. Alongside his new producer Rita Hanson and cameraman Larry, Phil travels to [[Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania|Punxsutawney]] for his annual coverage of the [[Groundhog Day]] festivities. He makes no secret of his contempt for the assignment, the small town, and the \"hicks\" who live there, asserting that he will soon be leaving his station for a new job.\n\n[[File:Groundhog day movie 1992 location 2007-03-18 IMG 4313.JPG|thumb|left|A private home in [[Woodstock, Illinois]] was used for exteriors of the Cherry Street Inn, the fictional loc",

The event formally began in 1887, although its roots go back even further.<ref name=\"Staff\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/news/groundhog-day-history-and-facts|title=Groundhog Day: History and Facts|website=History.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12|archive-date=2020-02-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200206214521/https://www.history.com/news/groundhog-day-history-and-facts|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe event is based upon a communal light-hearted [[suspension of disbelief]] which extends to the assertion that the same groundhog has been making predictions since the 19th century.\n\nThe event is organized by the \"Inner Circle\" – recognizable by their [[top hat]]s and [[tuxedo (clothing)|tuxedos]] – who ostensibly communicate with Phil to receive his prediction.\nThe vice president of the Inner Circle prepares two scrolls in advance of the actual ceremony, one proclaiming six more weeks of winter and one proclaiming an early spring. At daybreak on February 2, Punxsutawney Phil awakens from his burrow on Gobbler's Knob, is helped to the top of the stump by his handlers, and purportedly explains to the president of the Inner Circle, in a language known as \"Groundhogese\",<ref name=\"Staff\" /> whether he has seen his shadow. The president of the Inner Circle, the only person able to understand Groundhogese through his possession of an ancient [[acacia]] wood cane, then interprets Phil's message, and directs the vice president to read the proper scroll to the crowd gathered on Gobbler's Knob and the masses of \"phaithphil phollowers\" tuned in to live broadcasts around the world.<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKQhYPcNhx0 |title=Every Day Is Groundhog Day For Punxsutawney Phil’s Caretakers {{!}} TODAY Original |date=2020-02-01 |last=TODAY |access-date=2025-01-15 |via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nOutside of Groundhog Day, Phil resides with a mate, Phyllis, at the Punxsutawney Memorial Library in a climate-controlled environment. In March 2024, the Inner Circle announced that Phil had sired two babies, the first time in the history of the event that such a siring had happened; the birth surprised the Inner Circle, which had assumed that groundhogs do not breed in captivity. As a result of the births, the family will move permanently to Gobbler's Knob. The Inner Circle disowned the babies from ever inheriting their father's position.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-03-27 |title=Punxsutawney Phil surprises, starts family with 2 baby groundhogs |url=https://www.abc27.com/pennsylvania/exclusive-punxsutawney-phil-surprises-starts-family-with-2-baby-groundhogs/ |access-date=2024-03-28 |website=ABC27 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Punxsutawney Phil canon ==\nThe practices and lore of Punxsutawney Phil's predictions are predicated on a light-hearted suspension of disbelief by those involved.
