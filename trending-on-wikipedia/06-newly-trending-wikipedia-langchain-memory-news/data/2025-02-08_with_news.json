A renowned American football historian, Belichick is often referred to as a \"student of the game\" with a deep knowledge of the intricacies of each player position.

Marie Antoinette was the wife of [[Louis XVI]]. Born '''Archduchess Maria Antonia of Austria''', she was the penultimate child and youngest daughter of [[Empress Maria Theresa]] and [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Francis I]]. She married Louis Auguste, [[Dauphin of France]], in May 1770 at the age of 14. She then became the [[Dauphine of France]]. On 10 May 1774, her husband ascended the throne as Louis XVI and she became queen.\n\nAs queen, Marie Antoinette became increasingly a target of criticism by opponents of the domestic and foreign policies of Louis XVI, and those opposed to the monarchy in general. The French ''[[libelles]]'' accused her of being profligate,<ref>Royal household spending in 1788 was 13% of total state expenses(excluding interest on debts).

She was falsely accused of defrauding the Crown's jewelers in the [[Affair of the Diamond Necklace]], but the accusations damaged her reputation further. During the French Revolution, she became known as ''Madame Déficit'' because the country's [[financial crisis]] was blamed on her lavish spending and her opposition to social and financial reforms proposed by [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot]] and [[Jacques Necker]].\n\nSeveral events were linked to Marie Antoinette during the Revolution after the government placed the royal family under house arrest in the [[Tuileries Palace]] in October 1789. The June 1791 attempted [[flight to Varennes]] and her role in the [[War of the First Coalition]] were immensely damaging to her image among French citizens. On 10 August 1792, the attack on the Tuileries forced the royal family to take refuge at the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Assembly]], and they were imprisoned in the [[Temple Prison]] on 13 August 1792. On 21 September 1792, France was declared a republic and [[proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|the monarchy was abolished]]. [[Execution of Louis XVI|Louis XVI was executed]] by [[guillotine]] on 21 January 1793. Marie Antoinette's trial began on 14 October 1793; two days later, she was convicted by the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]] of high treason and executed by beheading by guillotine on 16 October 1793 at the [[Place de la Révolution]] during the French Revolution.\n\n==Early life (1755–1770)==\n[[File:Jean-Étienne_Liotard,_L'Archiduchesse_Marie-Antoinet",
