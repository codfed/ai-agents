Originally formed as Slayback's Missouri Cavalry Battalion, the unit consisted of men recruited in Missouri by Lieutenant Colonel Alonzo W. Slayback during Price's Raid in 1864. The battalion's first action was at the Battle of Pilot Knob on September 27; it later participated in actions at Sedalia, Lexington, and the Little Blue River. In October, the unit was used to find an alternate river crossing during the Battle of the Big Blue River. Later that month, Slayback's unit saw action at the battles of Westport, Marmiton River, and Second Newtonia. The battalion was briefly furloughed in Arkansas before rejoining Major General Sterling Price in Texas in December. Likely around February 1865, the battalion reached official regimental strength after more recruits joined.",

By the time of his execution, Mughals had been in control of most of Khandesh, forts of northern Maharashtra and Konkan.

Timothée Chalamet stars as Dylan, with Edward Norton, Elle Fanning, Monica Barbaro, Boyd Holbrook, Dan Fogler, Norbert Leo Butz, Eriko Hatsune, Big Bill Morganfield, Will Harrison, and Scoot McNairy in supporting roles. The film's title is derived from the chorus of Dylan's 1965 single \"Like a Rolling Stone\".",

Forsyth County's rapid population growth can be attributed to its proximity to high-income employment opportunities in nearby Alpharetta and northern Fulton County, its equidistant location between the big-city amenities of bustling Atlanta and the recreation offerings of the scenic Blue Ridge Mountains, its plentiful supply of large, relatively affordable new-construction homes, and its highly ranked public school system. The influx of high-income professionals and their families has increased the county's median annual household income dramatically in recent years; at $104,687, Forsyth County was the wealthiest in Georgia and the 19th-wealthiest in the United States as of 2018 estimates.",

Different systems for dividing society members into estates developed and evolved over time.The best known system is the French Ancien Régime, a three-estate system which was made up of a First Estate of clergy, a Second Estate of titled nobles, and a Third Estate of all other subjects.\nIn some regions, notably Sweden and Russia, burghers and rural commoners were split into separate estates, creating a four-estate system with rural commoners ranking the lowest as the Fourth Estate.\nIn Norway, the taxpaying classes were considered as one, and with a very small aristocracy; this class/estate was as powerful as the monarchy itself. In Denmark, however, only owners of large tracts of land had any influence. Furthermore, the non-landowning poor could be left outside the estates, leaving them without political rights.\nIn England, a two-estate system evolved that combined nobility and clergy into one lordly estate with \"commons\" as the second estate. This system produced the two houses of parliament, the House of Commons and the House of Lords.\nIn southern Germany, a three-estate system of nobility, knights, and burghers was used; this system excluded lower clergy and peasants altogether.\nIn Scotland, the Three Estates were the Clergy, Nobility, and Shire Commissioners, or \"burghers\", representing the bourgeoisie and lower commoners. The Estates made up a Scottish Parliament.",
