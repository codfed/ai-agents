One widespread theory is that [[food product]]s were buried in bogs to hinder spoilage.  Peat bogs, being [[refrigeration|low temperature]], low oxygen, highly acidic environments, have excellent preservative properties.  Experiments conducted by researcher Daniel C. Fisher demonstrated that pathogen and bacterial counts of meat buried in peat bogs for up to two years were comparable to levels found in control samples stored in a modern freezer,<ref name=Pobojewski>{{cite web |author=Pobojewski, Sally |title=Underwater Storage Techniques Preserved Meat for Early Hunters |publisher=The University Record |date=8 May 1995 |accessdate=15 Aug 2015 |url=http://www.ur.umich",
