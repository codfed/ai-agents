These people may or may not be distinguished by one or several characteristics, such as [[nobility]], [[celebrity|fame]], [[wealth]], [[education]], or [[corporate]], [[religious]], [[political]], or [[military]] control.\n\nThroughout history, power structures considered to be oligarchies have often been viewed as coercive, relying on public obedience or oppression to exist. [[Aristotle]] pioneered the use of the term as meaning rule by the rich, contrasting it with [[aristocracy]], arguing that oligarchy was the perverted form of aristocracy.<ref>Winters (2011) pp. 26–28. \"Aristotle writes that 'oligarchy is when men of property have the government in their hands... wherever men rule by reason of their wealth, whether they be few or many, that is an oligarchy, and where the poor rule, that is a democracy'.\"</ref>\n\n== Types ==\n=== Minority rule ===\n{{Main|Minoritarianism}}\n\nThe consolidation of power by a dominant religious or ethnic minority can be considered a form of oligarchy.<ref name=Minority1>{{cite book |last1=Coleman |first1=James |last2=Rosberg |first2=Carl |title=Political Parties and National Integration in Tropical Africa |url=https://archive.org/details/politicalparties0000cole |url-access=registration |date=1966 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/politicalparties0000cole/page/681 681–683] |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location=Los Angeles |isbn=978-0520002531}}</ref> Examples include South Africa during [[apartheid]], Liberia under [[Americo-Liberian people|Americo-Liberians]], the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar]],{{Citation needed|reason=How?|date=November 2024}} and [[Rhodesia]]. In these cases, oligarchic rule was often tied to the legacy of colonialism.<ref name=Minority1/> \n\nIn the early 20th century, [[Robert Michels]] expanded on this idea in his [[Iron Law of Oligarchy]] He argued that even democracies, like all large organizations, tend to become oligarchic due to the necessity of dividing labor, which ultimately results in a ruling class focused on maintaining its power.\n\n=== Putative oligarchies ===\n{{Main|Business oligarch}}\n\nBusiness groups may be considered oligarchies if they meet the following criteria:\n* They are the largest private owners in the country.\n* They possess sufficient political power to influence their own interests.\n* The owners control multiple businesses, coordinating activities across sectors.<ref name=\"Chern2018\">{{cite journal |last1=Chernenko |first1=Demid |title=Capital structure and oligarch ownership |journal=Economic Change and Restructuring |date=2018 |pages=383–411 |doi=10.1007/S10644-018-9226-9 |volume=52 |issue=4 |s2cid=56232563 |url=https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/83641/1/MPRA_paper_83641.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== Intellectual oligarchies ===\n[[George Bernard Shaw]] coined the concept of an intellectual oligarchy in his play ''[[Major Barbara]]'' (1907). In the play, Shaw criticizes the control of society by intellectual elites and expresses a desire for the empowerment of the common people:<ref>Shaw, Bernard und Baziyan, Vitaly. 2-in-1: English-German. Major Barbara & Major in Barbara. New York, 2020, {{ISBN|979-8692881076}}</ref><blockquote>I now want to give the common man weapons against the intellectual man. I love the common people. I want to arm them against the lawyer, the doctor, the priest, the literary man, the professor, the artist, and the politician, who, once in authority, is the most dangerous, disastrous, and tyrannical of all the fools, rascals, and impostors. I want a democratic power strong enough to force the intellectual oligarchy to use its genius for the general good or else perish.</blockquote>\n\n== Countries perceived as oligarchies ==\n[[Jeffrey A. Winters]] and [[Benjamin I. Page]] have described Colombia, Indonesia, Russia, Singapore and the United States as oligarchies.<ref name=\"winters2009\">{{Cite journal |last1=Winters |first1",

Lynch also created its [[Eraserhead (soundtrack)|score]] and sound design, which included pieces by a variety of other musicians.

Starring [[Jack Nance]], [[Charlotte Stewart]], [[Jeanne Bates]], [[Judith Roberts (actress)|Judith Anna Roberts]], Laurel Near, and [[Jack Fisk]], it tells the story of a man (Nance) who is left to care for his grossly deformed child in a desolate industrial landscape.\n\n''Eraserhead'' was produced with the assistance of the [[American Film Institute]] (AFI) during Lynch's time studying there. It nonetheless spent several years in [[principal photography]] because of funding difficulties; donations from Fisk and his wife [[Sissy Spacek]] as well as Nance's wife and crew member [[Catherine Coulson]] kept production afloat. It was shot on several locations owned by the AFI in California, [[Greystone Mansion]], and a set of disused stables in which Lynch lived. Lynch and sound designer [[Alan Splet]] spent a year working on the film's audio after their studio was soundproofed. The soundtrack features organ music by [[Fats Waller]] and includes the song \"[[In Heaven]]\", written and performed for the film by [[Peter Ivers]], with lyrics by Lynch.\n\nInitially opening to small audiences and little interest, ''Eraserhead'' gained popularity over several long runs as a [[midnight movie]]. Since its release, it has been praised and considered a [[cult film]]. Its surrealist imagery and sexual undercurrents have been seen as key thematic elements, and its intricate sound design as its technical highlight. In 2004, the film was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"2004Add\" />\n\n==Plot==\nHenry Spencer's face appears superimposed over a planet in space. He opens his mouth and a [[spermatozoon]]-like creature emerges. A man inside the planet moves a set of levers, and the creature swims away.\n\nIn an industrial cityscape, Henry walks home with his groceries. He is stopped outside his apartment by a beautiful girl across the hall, who informs him that his girlfriend, Mary, has invited him to dinner with her family. Henry leaves his groceries in his apartment, which is filled with piles of dirt and dead plants. That night, Henry visits Mary's home, conversing awkwardly with her mother. At the dinner table, he is asked to carve a chicken; the bird moves and writhes on the plate and gushes blood when cut. After dinner, Henry is cornered by Mary's mother, who tries to kiss him. She tells him that Mary has had his child and that the two must marry. Mary, however, is not sure if what she bore is a child.\n\nThe couple move into Henry's one-room apartment and begin caring for the child, a swaddled bundle with an inhuman face that resembles the spermatozoon cr",
