It was Lamar's fifth installment in his series of diss tracks directed at Drake premiering less than 20 hours after his previous single, \"[[Meet the Grahams]]\". Primarily produced by [[Mustard (record producer)|Mustard]], with additional work from [[Sounwave]] and [[Sean Momberger]], \"Not Like Us\" is a [[hyphy]]-influenced [[West Coast hip hop]] song composed of a prominent [[bassline]] with lively, synthesized strings and [[Finger snapping|finger snaps]]. Lyrically, it continues the themes first introduced in \"Meet the Grahams\" by doubling down on allegations of Drake's [[pedophilia]] and [[sexual misconduct]], while also criticizing his [[cultural identity]] and relationships with artists based in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]].\n\n\"Not Like Us\" was met with widespread acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]] and fans who felt it solidified Lamar's victory in the conflict. Many regard it as the best diss track in the feud, and one of the greatest diss tracks in history. The song ignited conversations based on [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and [[cultural appropriation]], was adopted as an anthem for the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], and influenced various sectors within [[popular culture]]. \"Not Like Us\" broke several records on the streaming platform [[Spotify]] and marked Lamar's fourth number-one song on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard ''Hot 100]]. It is also the longest-running number-one song on the [[Hot Rap Songs]] and [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] charts, while peaking in the top 20 in Australia, Canada, and several European countries.\n\nLamar first performed \"Not Like Us\" during [[The Pop Out: Ken & Friends]], where he played the track five consecutive times. An accompanying [[music video]], directed by [[Dave Free]] and Lamar, was released on [[Independence Day (United States)|American Independence Day]]. \"Not Like Us\" is the most decorated song in [[Grammy Awards]] history, sweeping all five of its nominations at the [[67th Annual Grammy Awards|67th ceremony]]: [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance|Best Rap Performance]], [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Song|Best Rap Song]], and [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Best Music Video]]. Lamar is the second rapper to win the first two categories above, joining [[Donald Glover|Childish Gambino]] for \"[[This Is America (song)|This is America]]\" in [[61st Annual Grammy Awards|2019]].\n\n== Background and release ==\n{{Further|Drake–Kendrick Lamar feud}}\nAmerican rapper [[Kendrick Lamar]] and Canadian rapper [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] have been engaged in a [[Drake–Kendrick Lamar feud|rap feud]] since August 2013. Tensions escalated in March 2024, following Lamar's surprise appearance on [[Future (rapper)|Future]] and [[Metro Boomin]]'s single \"[[Like That (Future, Metro Boomin and Kendrick Lamar song)|Like That]]\", which was perceived as a diss aimed at Drake and [[J. Cole]] over their track \"[[First Person Shooter (song)|First Person Shooter]]\". Drake responded to Lamar's verse with the single \"[[Push Ups (song)|Push Ups]]\" and the since-removed song \"[[Taylor Made Freestyle]]\". Lamar fired back with the songs \"[[Euphoria (Kendrick Lamar song)|Euphoria]]\" and \"[[6:16 in LA]]\".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Savage |first=Mark |date=2024-04-05 |title=Drake and Kendrick Lamar beef explained - what has happened and why? |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68739398 |access-date=2024-07-05 |work=[[BBC]] |language=en-GB |archive-date=April 24, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.o",

Sovereign wealth funds invest globally. Most SWFs are funded by revenues from commodity exports or from foreign exchange reserves held by the central bank.",
        "text": "{{short description|State-owned investment fund}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2022}}\n{{Public finance}}\nA '''sovereign wealth fund''' ('''SWF'''), or '''sovereign investment fund''', is a state-owned [[investment fund]] that invests in real and financial assets such as [[stock]]s, [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], real estate, [[precious metal]]s, or in alternative investments such as [[private equity funds]] or [[hedge fund]]s. Sovereign wealth funds invest globally. Most SWFs are funded by revenues from commodity exports or from [[foreign exchange reserves]] held by the [[central bank]].\n\nSome sovereign wealth funds may be held by a central bank, which accumulates the funds in the course of its management of a nation's banking system; this type of fund is usually of major economic and fiscal importance.  Other sovereign wealth funds are simply the state savings that are invested by various entities for investment return, and that may not have a significant role in fiscal management.\n\nThe accumulated funds may have their origin in, or may represent, foreign currency deposits, gold, [[special drawing rights]] (SDRs) and [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) reserve positions held by central banks and monetary authorities, along with other national assets such as pension investments, oil funds, or other industrial and financial holdings. These are assets of the sovereign nations that are typically held in domestic and different [[reserve currency|reserve currencies]] (such as the [[United States dollar|dollar]], [[euro]], [[Pound (currency)|pound]], and [[Japanese yen|yen]]). Such [[investment management]] entities may be set up as official investment companies, state pension funds, or sovereign funds, among others.\n\nThere have been attempts to distinguish funds held by sovereign entities from foreign-exchange reserves held by central banks. Sovereign wealth funds can be characterized as ''maximizing long-term return'', with foreign exchange reserves serving short-term \"currency stabilization\", and liquidity management. Many central banks in recent years possess reserves massively in excess of needs for liquidity or foreign exchange management.  Moreover, it is widely believed most have diversified hugely into assets other than short-term, highly liquid monetary ones, though almost no data is publicly available to back up this assertion.\n\n==History==\nThe term \"sovereign wealth fund\" was first used in 2005 by Andrew Rozanov in an article entitled, \"Who holds the wealth of nations?\" in the ''Central Banking Journal''.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ssga.com/library/esps/Who_Holds_Wealth_of_Nations_Andrew_Rozanov_8.15.05REVCCRI1145995576.pdf|title=Who holds the wealth of nations?|journal=[[Central Banking Journal]] |date=May 2005 |volume=15 |issue=4|access-date=2 September 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080529122341/http://www.ssga.com/library/esps/Who_Holds_Wealth_of_Nations_Andrew_Rozanov_8.15.05REVCCRI1145995576.pdf |archive-date = 29 May 2008}}</ref> The previous edition of the journal described the shift from traditional reserve management to sovereign wealth management; subsequently the term gained widespread use as the spending power of global officialdom has rocketed upward.{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}\n\n[[Sovereign funds of China|China's sovereign wealth]] funds entered global markets in 2007.<ref name=\":3\" />{{Rp|page=4}} Since then, their scale and scope have expanded significantly.<ref name=\":3\" />{{Rp|page=4}}\n\nSWFs were the first institutions to use sovereign capital in an effort to contain the financial damage in the early stages of the [[2007–2008 financial crisis|2007-2008 global financial crisis]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book |last=Liu |first=Zongyuan Zoe |title=Sovereign Funds: How the Communist Party of China Finances its Global Ambitions |publisher=The Belknap Press of [[Harvard University Press]] |year=2023 |isbn=9780674271913 |pages=}}</ref>{{Rp|pages=1–2}} SWFs are able to react quickly in such circumstances because unlike regulators, SWFs actively participate in the market.<ref name=\":3\" />{{Rp|page=2}}\n\nSWFs grew rapidly between 2008 and 2021, with global assets under management by these funds increasing from approximately $4 trillion to more than $10 trillion.<ref name=\":3\" />{{Rp|page=3}}\n\nSWFs invest in a variety of asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, private equity and hedge funds.
