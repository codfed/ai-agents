Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American universities. Since 2006, Facebook allows everyone to register from 13 years old, except in the case of a handful of nations, where the age requirement is 14 years.

In August, he signed [[Donald Trump–TikTok controversy#Executive order to ban TikTok|an executive order]] instructing that ByteDance divest from the app, though the order was blocked by a court injunction in September and was reversed by the [[Presidency of Joe Biden|Biden administration]] in 2021. However, in 2024, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act was proposed in [[United States Congress|Congress]], again ordering that ByteDance divest due to alleged security concerns and [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|pro-Palestinian]] bias. The bill was approved by Congress and signed into law by [[Joe Biden]]. Following [[TikTok v. Garland|a lawsuit]] from TikTok, the law was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].\n\nOn January 18, 2025, the day before the deadline of the law, TikTok temporarily suspended its services in the United States. The following day, after [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] Trump signaled that he would grant an extension to TikTok upon [[Second inauguration of Donald Trump|being inaugurated]], services were restored.

The result was that TikTok owner [[ByteDance]]—which initially planned on selling a small portion of TikTok to an American company—agreed to [[Divestment|divest]] TikTok to prevent a ban in the United States and in other countries where restrictions are also being considered due to privacy concerns, which themselves are mostly related to its ownership by a firm based in China.\n\nTikTok later announced plans to file legal action challenging the order's transactional prohibitions with U.S. companies. The lawsuit against the [[First presidency of Donald Trump|Trump Administration]]'s order was filed on August 24, 2020, with TikTok arguing that the order was motivated by Trump's efforts to boost re-election support through [[protectionism|protectionist]] trade policies aimed at China. A separate suit filed the same day by TikTok's U.S. technical [[Program management|program manager]] Patrick Ryan against Trump and [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]] [[Wilbur Ross]] sought a [[Injunction#Temporary restraining orders|temporary restraining order]], arguing that his [[due process]] rights were violated and the ban was an \"unconstitutional taking\" of Ryan's property under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]; the suit also claimed Trump's action was likely a retaliation because of TikTok videos organizing pranks against a recent Trump campaign rally.\n\nAmerican technology company [[Microsoft]] had previously proposed an idea to acquire TikTok's algorithm and other [[artificial intelligence]] technology, but this was declined by ByteDance, as its executives expressed concern that it would likely be opposed by the [[Government of China|Chinese government]], which in turn had criticized the Trump Administration's order as a \"smash and grab\" forced sale. On September 13, 2021, ByteDance suggested that it would prefer the shuttering of U.S. operations over such a sale.\n\n== Background ==\n{{See also|Internet censorship in the United States}}\n\nIn January 2019, an investigation by the American think tank [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] described TikTok as a \"[[Huawei]]-sized problem\" that posed a national security threat to the West because of the app's popularity with Western users.<ref name=\"2019-01-14-twnews\">{{cite web|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3616776|title=Report warns of security concerns amid sudden rise of TikTok|website=Taiwan News|date=January 14, 2019 |access-date=1 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190302024959/https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3616776|archive-date=2 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"2019-01-11-piie\">{{cite web|url=https://piie.com/blogs/china-economic-watch/growing-popularity-chinese-social-media-outside-china-poses-new-risks|title=The Growing Popularity of Chinese Social Media Outside China Poses New Risks in the West|date=11 January 2019|website=PIIE|access-date=1 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190212070508/https://piie.com/blogs/china-economic-watch/growing-popularity-chinese-social-media-outside-china-poses-new-risks|archive-date=12 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> They included risks to armed forces personnel due to the app's alleged ability to convey location, image, and [[Biometrics|biometric data]] to its Chinese parent company, which is legally unable to refuse to share data with the Chinese government under the [[China Internet Security Law]].<ref name=\"2019-01-14-twnews\" /> [[ByteDance]]'s founder and CEO [[Zhang Yiming]] issued a letter in 2018 stating that his company would \"further deepen cooperation\" with the ruling [[Chinese Communist Party]] to promote its policies.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/01/16/bytedance-cant-outrun-beijings-shadow/|title=ByteDance Can't Outrun Beijing's Shadow|last=Spence|first=Philip|date=16 January 2019|website=[[Foreign Policy]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190116235819/https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/01/16/bytedance-cant-outrun-beijings-shadow/|archive-date=16 January 2019|access-date=15 September 2019}}</ref> ByteDance contends that TikTok is not available in China and its data is stored outside of China, but its privacy policy has reserved the right to share any information with Chinese authorities.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-04-18/tiktok-brings-chinese-style-censorship-to-america-s-tweens|title=The Kids Use TikTok Now Because Data-Mined Videos Are So Much Fun|date=18 April 2019 |publisher=[[Bloomber",

After establishing himself in the [[Music of Detroit#Hip-hop|Detroit hip-hop]] scene, he broke through into mainstream success with a [[rap rock]] sound before shifting his performance style to [[country rock]]. A self-taught musician, he has said he can play every instrument in his backing band and has overseen production on all but two of his albums.\n\nKid Rock started his music career as a rapper, releasing his debut album ''[[Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast]]'' (1990), on [[Jive Records]]. His subsequent independent releases ''[[The Polyfuze Method]]'' (1993) and ''[[Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp]]'' (1996) saw him developing a more distinctive style, which was fully realized on his breakthrough album ''[[Devil Without a Cause]]'' (1998), which sold 14 million copies. This album and its follow-up, ''[[Cocky (album)|Cocky]]'' (2001), were noted for blending elements of hip-hop, country, and rock.\n\nHis most successful single from that time period, \"[[Cowboy (Kid Rock song)|Cowboy]]\" (1999), is considered a pioneering song in the [[country rap]] genre. His best-selling singles overall are \"[[Picture (song)|Picture]]\" (2002) and \"[[All Summer Long (Kid Rock song)|All Summer Long]]\" (2008). Starting with his 2007 album ''[[Rock n Roll Jesus]]'', his musical output has tended to be in the country rock style. Politically, Ritchie is a vocal supporter of the U.S. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and holds conservative views.\n\n==Early life==\nRobert James Ritchie was born in [[Romeo, Michigan]], on January 17, 1971, the son of Susan and William \"Bill\" Ritchie (1941–2024),<ref>{{cite web |title=Bill Ritchie, former Sterling Heights auto dealer and father of Kid Rock, dies in Florida |url=https://www.freep.com/story/entertainment/music/brian-mccollum/2024/02/16/bill-ritchie-father-of-kid-rock-and-ex-sterling-heights-auto-dealer-dies/72633949007/ |website=www.freep.com}}</ref> who owned multiple car dealerships.<ref name=\"Biography\">{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/kid-rock-251986|title=Kid Rock|website=Biography.com|access-date=October 13, 2017|archive-date=October 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013224846/https://www.biography.com/people/kid-rock-251986|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Allmusic\"/><ref name=\"cowboysindians\"/> He was raised in his father's large home on extensive property,<ref name=\"Biography\"/><ref name=Freep2016>{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/macomb/2016/11/04/kid-rock-macomb-county-house/93299716/|title=Kid Rock's posh childhood home listed in Macomb County for $1.3M|website=Freep.com|access-date=November 3, 2017|archive-date=November 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107142821/http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/macomb/2016/11/04/kid-rock-macomb-county-house/93299716/|url-status=live}}</ref> which included an [[apple orchard]] and barnyard for their horses.<ref name=\"The Independent\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/my-secret-life-kid-rock-musician-age-37-870596.html|title=My Secret Life: Kid Rock Musician (age 37)|last=Philby|first=Charlotte|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=November 30, 2010|location=London|date=July 19, 2008|archive-date=March 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324122407/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/my-secret-life-kid-rock-musician-age-37-870596.html|url-status=live}}</ref> He attended [[Romeo High School]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://w",
