Gumbo is often categorized by the type of thickener used, whether [[okra]] or [[filé powder]] (dried and ground [[Sassafras albidum|sassafras]] leaves).\n\nGumbo can be made with or without okra or filé powder. The preferred method in the historical [[Cuisine of New Orleans|New Orleans variation]] is with a French dark, even chocolate-like, [[roux]]. The flavor of the dish has its origins in many cultures.  [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] gumbo generally contains [[shellfish]] and a dark roux, filé, or both. [[Cajun cuisine|Cajun]] gumbo is generally based on a dark roux and is made with shellfish or [[fowl]]. [[Sausage]] or ham is often added to gumbos of either variety. After the base is prepared, vegetables are cooked down, and then meat is added. The dish simmers for a minimum of three hours, with shellfish and some spices added near the end. If desired, filé powder is added after the pot is removed from heat. Gumbo is traditionally served with [[rice]]. A third, lesser-known variety, the meatless gumbo z'herbes, is essentially a gumbo of slow-cooked [[leaf vegetable|greens]].\n\nThe dish combines ingredients and culinary practices of several cultures, including African, French, German, Spanish, and Native American [[Choctaw]]. Gumbo may have been based on traditional native dishes, or may be a derivation of the French dish [[bouillabaisse]], or Choctaw stew, but most likely all of these dishes contributed to the original recipe. It was first described in 1802, and was listed in various cookbooks in the latter half of the 19th century. The dish gained more widespread popularity in the 1970s, after the [[United States Senate]] dining room added it to the menu in honor of Louisiana Senator [[Allen Ellender]]. The popularity of chef [[Paul Prudhomme]] in the 1980s spurred further interest in the dish.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name of the dish comes most likely from Africa, by way of [[Louisiana French]]. Scholars and chefs have offered various explanations for the [[etymology]] of the word \"gumbo\". The dish was likely named after one of its two main ingredients, okra<ref>{{Cite web |last=Guilbeau |first=Joe |title=On the Lighter Side: The story of Cajun food |url=https://www.postsouth.com/story/news/columns/2022/08/03/history-and-tradition-staples-cajun-cuisine/10200375002/ |access-date=2022-12-07 |website=Plaquemine Post South |language=en-US}}</ref> or filé.

Specifically, it is used to treat methemoglobin levels that are greater than 30% or in which there are symptoms despite oxygen therapy.
