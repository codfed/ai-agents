Despite the negative reception, ''The Swan'' premiered to high ratings and averaged around 9 million viewers over the course of its first season. Since its conclusion, most contestants have voiced satisfaction with their participation in the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2024-06-25/the-swan-reality-competition-20th-anniversary |title=Plastic surgery, therapy, a pageant: In 2004, 'The Swan' predicted reality TV's future |last=Blake |first=Meredith |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 25, 2024 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240625100837/https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2024-06-25/the-swan-reality-competition-20th-anniversary |archive-date=June 25, 2024}}</ref> According to producers, the show's purpose was to increase the self-esteem of its contestants. In 2013, Fox announced plans to revive the series as a two-hour television special titled '''''Celebrity Swan''''', but as of 2018 it was no longer in development.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://jezebel.com/celebroty-swan-is-the-most-depressing-television-progra-5985698|title=''Celebrity Swan'' is the Most Depressing Television Program Ever Conceived|magazine=Jezebel|last=West|first=Lindy|date=February 20, 2013|access-date=February 20, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=White |first=Adam |date=2018-06-14 |title=When makeovers go wrong: why The Swan is one of the most horrific TV shows ever made |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/makeover-shows-go-wrong-life-ruining-legacy-swan/ |access-date=2024-02-07 |work=The Telegraph |language=en-GB |issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nEach episode of the series followed two self-proclaimed \"[[The Ugly Duckling|ugly ducklings]]\" who, over the course of a three-month period, experienced an extreme makeover from a team that included a personal trainer, therapist, dentist, and cosmetic surgeons. Whichever woman was deemed more attractive at the end of the three months would move forward to compete in a beauty pageant held at the end of the season.  Following the pageant, whichever contestant received the most votes for the greatest transformation would be given the title \"The Swan\".\n\n==Production==\nIn 2005, Rebecca Hertz, a writer of the series, admitted that the series' staff manufactured dialogue and situations throughout the editing process. Hertz claimed that she falsely made it appear as though contestant Rachel Love-Fraser's husband was unhappily married to her, stating, \"In a pre-interview, I led her husband to say Rachel looks average, but he thought she looked beautiful. I cut it down to him saying she looks average, so he sounded like a mean, horrible a–hole. He was furious when he saw the show\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/article/2005/06/30/reality_franken/|title=Reality TV: More proof that it ain't so real|last=Ryan|first=Amy|date=June 30, 2005|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|language=en-US|access-date=June 21, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220522193246/https://ew.com/article/2005/06/30/reality_franken/|archive-date=May 22, 2022|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Series overview==\n\n===Season 1 (2004)===\n''The Swan'' debuted on April 7, 2004.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
