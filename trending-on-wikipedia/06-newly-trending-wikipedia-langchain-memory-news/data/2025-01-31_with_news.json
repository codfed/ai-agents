She became one of the leading female artists of the [[British Invasion]] in the United States.\n\nBorn in [[Hampstead]], London, Faithfull began her career in 1964 after attending a party for [[the Rolling Stones]], where she was discovered by the band's manager [[Andrew Loog Oldham]]. Her 1965 debut studio album ''[[Marianne Faithfull (album)|Marianne Faithfull]]'', released simultaneously with her studio album ''[[Come My Way]]'', was a huge success and was followed by further albums on [[Decca Records]]. From 1966 to 1970 she had a highly publicised romantic relationship with [[Mick Jagger]]. Her popularity was enhanced by roles in films, including ''[[I'll Never Forget What's'isname]]'' (1967), ''[[The Girl on a Motorcycle]]'' (1968) and ''[[Hamlet (1969 film)|Hamlet]]'' (1969). Her popularity was overshadowed by personal problems in the 1970s, when she became [[anorexic]], homeless and [[addicted to heroin]].\n\nDuring her 1960s musical career, Faithfull was noted for her distinctive melodic, high-register vocals. In the subsequent decade her voice was altered by severe [[laryngitis]] and persistent [[drug abuse]], which left her sounding permanently raspy, cracked and lower in pitch. The new sound was praised as \"whisky soaked\" by some critics and was seen as having helped to capture the raw emotions expressed in her music.<ref name=\"autobio\"/>\n\nAfter a long absence, Faithfull made a musical comeback in 1979 with the release of a critically acclaimed seventh studio album, ''[[Broken English (album)|Broken English]]''. The album was a commercial success and marked a resurgence of her musical career. ''Broken English'' earned Faithfull a nomination for a [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] and is regarded as her \"definitive recording\". She followed this with a series of studio albums including ''[[Dangerous Acquaintances]]'' (1981), ''[[A Child's Adventure]]'' (1983) and ''[[Strange Weather (Marianne Faithfull album)|Strange Weather]]'' (1987). Faithfull wrote three books about her life: ''[[Faithfull: An Autobiography]]'' (1994), ''Memories, Dreams & Reflections'' (2007) and ''Marianne Faithfull: A Life on Record'' (2014).\n\nFaithfull received the World Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2009 [[Women's World Award]]s, and in 2011 she was made a {{lang|fr|Commandeur}} of the {{lang|fr|[[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]]}} by the government of France.\n\n==Early life==\n\n=== Ancestry ===\nFaithfull was born in [[Hampstead]], London. Her father, Major Robert Glynn Faithfull, was a [[British intelligence agencies|British intelligence]] officer and professor of Italian literature at [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College,]] London University. Her mother, Eva, was the daughter of Artur Wolfgang [[Ritter]] von Sacher-Masoch (1875–1953), an [[Austrian nobility|Austro-Hungarian nobleman]] of old [[Polonized]] Catholic [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] nobility. Eva chose to [[Courtesy style|style]] herself as [[Eva von Sacher-Masoch|Eva von Sacher-Masoch, Baroness Erisso]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whodoyouthinkyouaremagazine.com/episode/marianne-faithfull|title=Marianne Faithfull|work=Who Do You Think You Are?

Officially launched in 1997, the CRJ700's [[maiden flight]] took place on 27 May 1999; it was soon followed by the stretched '''CRJ900''' variant. Several additional variants of the type were subsequently introduced, including the elongated '''CRJ1000,''' and the '''CRJ550''' and '''CRJ705''', which were modified to comply with [[scope clause]]s. The CRJ program was acquired by the Japanese corporation [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] in 2020, which ended production of the aircraft.\n\nTheir design was derived from the smaller [[Bombardier CRJ100/200|CRJ100 and 200]] airliners, the other members of the [[Bombardier CRJ]] aircraft family. During the 1990s, Bombardier initiated development on the ''CRJ-X'', a program to produce enlarged derivatives of its popular CRJ100/200 family. During its lifetime, competitors included the [[British Aerospace 146]], the [[Embraer E-Jet family]], the [[Fokker 70]], and the [[Fokker 100]].\n\nIn Bombardier's lineup, the ''CRJ{{Nbsp}}Series'' was marketed alongside a family of larger jets, the ''C{{Nbsp}}Series'' (now owned by [[Airbus]] and marketed as the [[Airbus A220]]), and a [[turboprop]], the ''Q''{{Nbsp}}''Series'' (now owned by [[De Havilland Canada]] and marketed as the [[Dash 8]]). During the late 2010s, Bombardier sought to sell off several of its aircraft programs. The CRJ program was acquired by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in a deal that closed 1 June 2020.<ref name=\"mhidealclosed\" /> Bombardier continued to manufacture aircraft at the Mirabel facility until the order backlog was completed in December 2020.<ref name=\"JDM12dec2020\">{{cite news |author=Sylvain Larocque |date=12 December 2020 |title=Une belle page de l'histoire aéronautique québécoise se tourne |url=https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2020/12/12/une-belle-page-de-lhistoire-aeronautique-quebecoise-se-tourne |newspaper=[[Le Journal de Montréal]] |language=fr}}</ref> Mitsubishi will continue to manufacture parts for existing CRJ operators, but currently does not plan to sell or build any new CRJ aircraft, originally planning to focus on their [[Mitsubishi SpaceJet|SpaceJet]] aircraft, for which development has now also ceased.\n\n== Development ==\n=== Origins ===\nDuring the early 1990s, [[Bombardier Aerospace]] became interested in developing larger variants of the CRJ100/200 series; associated design work commenced in 1994.<ref name=\"markets 1997\">[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/making-markets-52/ \"Making markets.\"] ''Flight International'', 5 March 1997.</ref> The ''CRJ-X'', as the new range was initially designated, sought to compete with larger [[regional jet]]s such as the [[Fokker 70]]/[[Fokker 100]] or the [[BAe 146]] family.<ref>Doyle, Andrew., Jennifer Pite and Graham Warwick.

Sikorsky submitted the S-70 design for the [[United States Army]]'s Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS) competition in 1972. The Army designated the prototype as the ''YUH-60A'' and selected the Black Hawk as the winner of the program in 1976, after a fly-off competition with the [[Boeing Vertol YUH-61]].\n\nNamed after the Native American war leader [[Black Hawk (Sauk leader)|Black Hawk]], the UH-60A entered service with the U.S. Army in 1979, to replace the [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois]] as the Army's tactical transport helicopter. This was followed by the fielding of [[electronic warfare]] and [[special operations]] variants of the Black Hawk. Improved UH-60L and UH-60M utility variants have also been developed. Modified versions have also been developed for the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], and [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]]. In addition to U.S. Army use, the UH-60 family has been exported to several nations. Black Hawks have served in combat during conflicts in [[Grenada]], [[Panama]], [[Iraq]], [[Somalia]], [[Ukraine]], the [[Balkans]], [[Afghanistan]], and other areas in the [[Middle East]].\n\nMajor variants include the [[Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk]] used for naval purposes, [[Sikorsky HH-60 Pave Hawk]] for combat search and rescue, with other upgrades for various export, VIP, and special operation variants. The latest utility variant is the UH-60M.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Sikorsky YUH-60A and Boeing Vertol YUH-61A flyoff.jpg|thumb|The flyoff competition in the mid-1970s between the Sikorsky YUH-60A (in front) and Boeing Vertol YUH-61A prototypes]]\n\n===Initial requirement===\nIn the late 1960s, the United States Army began forming requirements for a helicopter to replace the [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1 Iroquois]], and designated the program as the Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS). The Army also initiated the development of a new, common turbine engine for its helicopters that would become the [[General Electric T700]]. Based on experience in Vietnam, the Army required significant performance, survivability and reliability improvements from both UTTAS and the new powerplant.<ref>Leoni 2007, pp. 8–10.</ref> The Army released its UTTAS request for proposals (RFP) in January 1972.<ref>Leoni 2007, pp. 11, 39.</ref> The RFP also included air transport requirements.

According to the NTSB, the aggressive use of the rudder controls by the first officer stressed the [[vertical stabilizer]] until it separated from the aircraft. The airliner's two engines also separated from the aircraft before impact due to the intense forces.<ref name=\"AAR-04-04 Final Report\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/aviation-international-news/2007-02-01/ntsb-report-aa-587-spreads-blame |title=NTSB report on AA 587 Spreads Blame |last=Lowe |first=Paul |date=February 1, 2008 |publisher=Aviation International News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819125554/http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/aviation-international-news/2007-02-01/ntsb-report-aa-587-spreads-blame |archive-date=August 19, 2014 |url-status=live |access-date=August 18, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Aircraft and crew ==\nThe accident aircraft, [[aircraft registration|registration]] {{Airreg|N|14053|,}} was an [[Airbus A300]] B4-605R delivered new to [[American Airlines]] on 12 July 1988.

The airline is a wholly owned subsidiary of the [[American Airlines Group]] and it is paid by fellow group member [[American Airlines]] to staff, operate and maintain aircraft used on [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] flights that are scheduled, marketed and sold by American Airlines.\n\nPSA Airlines operates a fleet consisting of exclusively [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] regional jet aircraft. The company has a team of more than 5,000 employees, operating more than 800 daily flights to nearly 100 destinations.\n\nThe airline is named after [[Pacific Southwest Airlines]] (commonly known as PSA), one of the predecessors of today's American Airlines, to protect the trademark.\n\n==History==\n\n===Vee Neal Airlines===\nNamed after its owner Vee Neal Frey, '''Vee Neal Airlines''' was established in [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania]], and received an [[air operator's certificate]] in 1979. At first, the company operated as a [[fixed-base operator]], and later added scheduled service between Latrobe and [[Pittsburgh International Airport|Pittsburgh]] with a [[Cessna 402]] in May 1980.<ref name=psahistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.psaairlines.com/cohist.asp|title=PSA Airlines Company History|publisher=psaairlines.com|date=August 1, 2012|access-date=October 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513004956/http://www.psaairlines.com/cohist.asp|archive-date=May 13, 2006|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Airline Deregulation Act]] of 1978, nearby [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], saw a decline in service, and Vee Neal saw an opportunity. The company made several unsuccessful attempts to start a new airline operation out of [[Erie International Airport]] using [[Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante]] aircraft. A breakthrough would finally come in April 1983 when [[USAir]] announced it would further reduce frequencies out of Erie and would discontinue nonstop service to Chicago from Erie. Vee Neal Airlines was able to raise [[venture capital]] from a group of civic and business leaders, investors and corporations in the Erie area. The money was used to purchase six [[British Aerospace Jetstream 31]] aircraft, which would operate out of Erie, PA.\n\n===Jetstream International Airlines===\nIn December 1983, the airline was renamed to Jetstream International Airlines (JIA) after it took delivery of its first two Jetstream aircraft. The next year, the company relocated its maintenance department and corporate headquarters from Latrobe to Erie.\n\nJetstream established a network of routes between Erie and [[Chicago]], [[Cleveland]], [[Detroit]], [[Harrisburg]], [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] In addition, Jetstream provided service between [[Youngstown, Ohio]], and both airports in Detroit.\n\nThe airline struggled financially, but on September 26, 1985, it secured a deal with [[Piedmont Airlines (1948–1989)|Piedmont Airlines]] to operate flights under the Piedmont Commuter brand connecting Erie with Piedmont's Baltimore and Dayton hubs and Youngstown with Baltimore.\n\nStill suffering financially, the next year Piedmont offered to buy Jetstream in a deal that closed on August 1, 1986. Piedmont immediately pivoted Jetstream's business model, making it a Piedmont Commuter feeder for their Dayton hub on September 15, 1986. In 1987, Jetstream once again moved its corporate headquarters, this time to its new base of ope",
