Upon leaving the RAF the two aspiring actors both performed in productions by the Dramatic Society at the [[Borough Polytechnic Institute]] (now [[London South Bank University]]).\n\n==Career==\n===Early career===\nMurphy was a member of the [[Theatre Workshop]] (alongside future TV co-star [[Yootha Joyce]]), and a jobbing actor in the 1960s and early 1970s, combining his theatre work with guest appearances in television shows such as ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Z-Cars]]'', ''[[Callan (TV series)|Callan]]'' and ''[[Dixon of Dock Green]]'', before being cast in the role which would make him a household name.\n\n===''Man About the House'' and ''George and Mildred''===\nMurphy first came to prominence in the ITV television sitcom ''[[Man About the House]]'',<ref>{{cite news |date=1976-09-13 |title=Brian Murphy as George Roper in Man about the house |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/grimsby-evening-telegraph-brian-murphy-a/139319236/ |access-date=2024-01-22 |work=Grimsby Evening Telegraph |pages=7}}</ref> playing George Roper, whose wife, Mildred, played by Yootha Joyce, was a domineering social climber – a sharp contrast to the character of George, a lazy landlord whose desire was for an easy and quiet life. The pairing was an instant hit.<ref name=\"Grdn2023\"/> A contributing factor to the actors' immediate chemistry was that they had been friends for many years. Aside from their Theatre Workshop years, Murphy also featured opposite Joyce in ''[[Sparrows Can't Sing]]'' (1963).\n\nWhen ''Man About The House'' ended in 1976, a spin-off was created for Murphy and Joyce, titled ''[[George and Mildred]]''. This ran for five series until 1979. In 1978 he released the single \"Jogging\" (b/w \"The Great Gnome Robbery\"), recorded in the persona of George, on the [[Pye Records|Pye]] label. Murphy later said, \"Out of the blue I was requested to record 'Jogging' in the manner of George, and naturally could not refuse. I had been told I had an excellent singing voice and in fact did some training, but sadly I lacked confidence and missed opportunities – one of my biggest regrets.\"<ref name=\"comedy\">{{cite web |url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/brian_murphy/features/brian-murphy-on-george-mildred/ |title=Brian Murphy interview |website=[[British Comedy Guide]] |date=6 Septem",

Bukele entered politics in 2011; the following year, he joined the FMLN and was elected mayor of [[Nuevo Cuscatlán]]. Bukele served until his 2015 election as [[mayor of San Salvador]], where he served until 2018. In 2017, Bukele was ousted from the FMLN; he founded the [[Nuevas Ideas]] political party shortly afterward and pursued a presidential campaign in [[2019 Salvadoran presidential election|2019]]. After the [[Supreme Electoral Court (El Salvador)|Supreme Electoral Court]] (TSE) refused to register his party, Bukele ran for president with the [[Grand Alliance for National Unity]] (GANA) and won with 53 percent of the vote.\n\nBukele implemented the [[Territorial Control Plan]] in July 2019 to reduce El Salvador's 2019 [[homicide]] rate of 38 per 100,000 people. Homicides fell by 50 percent during Bukele's first year in office following a trending decline that began in 2016; Bukele attributed the homicide decrease to the plan. Digital ne",
