Burnham's work combines elements of filmmaking with [[Comedy music|music]], [[Sketch comedy|sketch]], and [[stand-up comedy]], commonly with a dramatic, satirical, or tragic twist that is often left open to interpretation.\n\nIn 2006, Burnham created a [[YouTube]] channel, where he uploaded videos of him playing [[comedy song|comedic songs]] that he wrote, often featuring [[wordplay]] and taboo or dark subject matter. Despite only being in his late teens, his music videos quickly went [[viral videos|viral]], making him one of the earliest YouTube stars. He began creating albums featuring his songs, such as ''[[Bo fo Sho]]'' (2008) and the self-titled album ''[[Bo Burnham (album)|Bo Burnham]]'' (2009).\n\nBurnham switched his focus from YouTube to performing [[stand-up comedy]] routines, which combined his comedy songs with traditional stand-up. He released three comedy specials, ''[[Words Words Words]]'' (2010), ''[[what.]]'' (2013), and ''[[Make Happy]]'' (2016). He also worked on the music and script for a comedy film that was ultimately scrapped. Burnham created and starred in the 2013 [[MTV]] [[mockumentary]] series ''[[Zach Stone Is Gonna Be Famous]]''. He also published the poetry book ''[[Egghead: Or, You Can't Survive on Ideas Alone]]'' (2013). In 2016, Burnham announced his intention to step away from performing live, which he later revealed to be due to him suffering from [[anxiety]] and experiencing [[panic attacks]] on stage. He went on to make his filmmaking debut as the writer and director of the drama film ''[[Eighth Grade (film)|Eighth Grade]]'' (2018) and began directing other comedians' comedy specials, as well as co-starring in the dark comedy thriller film ''[[Promising Young Woman]]'' (2020).\n\nBurnham returned to performing with his fourth comedy special, ''[[Bo Burnham: Inside|Inside]]'' (2021), which he created in his home without a crew or audience during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]; it was released by [[Netflix]] to widespread acclaim, including [[List_of_Peabody_Award_winners_(2020–2029)#2021|a Peabody Award]]. The special was nominated in six categories at the [[73rd Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards|73rd Emmy Awards]], winning three. At the [[64th Annual Grammy Awards|64th Grammy Awards]], ''Inside'' was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Music Film|Best Music Film]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media|Best Song Written for Visual Media]], winning the latter.

[[Otto Kuntze|Kuntze]]</small>\n}}\n\n'''''Dendrocnide moroides''''', commonly known in Australia as the '''stinging tree''', '''stinging bush''', or '''gympie-gympie''', is a plant in the nettle family [[Urticaceae]] found in rainforest areas of [[Malesia]] and [[Australia]].<ref name=\"RFK\"/> It is notorious for its extremely painful and long-lasting sting. The common name gympie-gympie comes from the language of the indigenous [[Gubbi Gubbi people]] of south-eastern Queensland.\n\n==Description==\n''D. moroides'' is a straggly perennial shrub, usually flowering and fruiting when less than {{cvt|3|m|ft|0}} tall, but it may reach up to {{cvt|10|m|ft|0}} in height. It is superficially similar to ''[[Dendrocnide cordifolia]]'', with the most obvious difference being the point of attachment of the [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] to the leaf blade—where ''D. moroides'' is [[Glossary of leaf morphology#peltate|peltate]], i.e. the stalk attaches to the underside of the leaf and not at the edge, ''D.&nbsp;cordifolia'' is [[Glossary of leaf morphology#cordate|cordate]]. The stem, branches, petioles, leaves, and fruits are all covered in stinging hairs.{{r|RFK|RFK2}}\n\nIt has large, heart-shaped, [[Glossary of leaf morphology|simple]] leaves about {{cvt|12–22|cm|frac=2}} long and {{cvt|11–18|cm|frac=2}} wide with toothed margins, a pointed tip and a cordate to [[Glossary of botanical terms#obtuse|obtuse]] base shape. There are six to eight pairs of lateral veins either side of the [[Glossary of botanical terms#midrib|midrib]]. The petiole (leaf stem) is quite long, about as long as the leaf blade itself, with [[stipule]]s about {{cvt|1-2|cm|in|frac=4}} long.{{r|RFK|FOA}}\n\n[[File:AULakeEuchamDendrocnide moroides.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Fruit]]\n\nThe [[inflorescence]] is [[Monoecy|monoecious]] (rarely dioecious),{{R|JACKES}} and is borne in the leaf [[Glossary of botanical terms#axil|axils]]. It is up to {{cvt|15|cm|in|frac=2}} long, often paired.{{r|FOA}} It carries both male and female flowers which are quite small, the [[Glossary of botanical terms#perianth|perianth]] measuring less than {{cvt|1|mm|2}} across. Flowering occurs throughout the year, but mostly in summer.{{r|RFK|FOA}}\n\nThe fruit of this species is an [[achene]] (a tiny seed-like fruit), produced in number in a globular structure which is pink to light-purple in colour and has an appearance similar to a [[mulberry]]. Each achene, measuring just {{cvt|2|mm|2}} long, is contained in a small fleshy sac which derives from the swollen [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]].{{r|RFK|FOA}} As with the rest of this plant, the [[infructescence]]s are also covered in stinging hairs, but are edible if the hairs are removed.{{r|COOPER1|TIMLOW|AJEBMS|WAEM}}\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe [[Type (biology)|type specimen]] for this species was collected in 1819 by [[Allan Cunningham (botanist)|Allan Cunningham]] near the [[Endeavour River]],{{r|RFK}} and was first described in 1857 by [[Hugh Algernon Weddell]] as ''Laportea moroides''  in his work ''Monographie de la Famille des Urticées'', published in the journal ''Archives du Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle''.{{R|AMHN}} The current binomial combination was published by [[Wee-Lek Chew]] in ''The Gardens' Bulletin Singapore'' in 1966.{{R|GBS|IPNI}}\n\n===Etymology===\nThe genus name ''Dendrocnide'' has been constructed on the Ancient Greek δένδρον {{transliteration|grc|déndron}}, meaning \"tree\", and κνίδος {{transliteration|grc|knídos}}, meaning \"stinging needle\". The [[Botanical name#Binary name|species epithet]] ''moroides'' is created from the genus name for mulberries ''[[Morus (plant)|Morus]]'', combined with the Greek suffix ''-oides'', meaning \"resembling\", referring to the mulberry-like infructescence.{{r|FOA|COOPER2}} The binomial name may be translated as \"mulberry-like stinging tree\".{{R|AAAS}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Dendrocnide moroides small plant SF21168.jpg|thumb|Small plant at [[Crystal Cascades]] near [[Cairns]], Queensland, June 2021]]\n\nThe species occurs in and near rainforest, from [[Cape York Peninsula]] south to northern [[New",
