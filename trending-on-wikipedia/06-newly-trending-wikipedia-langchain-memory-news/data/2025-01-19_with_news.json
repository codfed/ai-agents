She spent almost four years incarcerated in Italy after her wrongful conviction in the 2007 [[murder of Meredith Kercher]], a fellow [[exchange student]], with whom she shared an apartment in [[Perugia]]. In 2015, Knox was definitively acquitted by the [[Supreme Court of Cassation (Italy)|Italian Supreme Court of Cassation]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Italy's top court says Amanda Knox case had 'major flaws' |url=https://www.dw.com/en/italys-top-court-says-amanda-knox-case-had-major-flaws/a-18699755 |website=Deutsche Welle |access-date=6 May 2022}}</ref> In 2024, an Italian appellate court upheld Amanda Knox's slander conviction for falsely accusing Patrick Lumumba of murdering Meredith Kercher.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/05/europe/amanda-knox-slander-meredith-kercher-murder-intl/index.html | title=Amanda Knox's slander conviction upheld in case related to Meredith Kercher's murder | date=June 5, 2024 }}</ref>\n\nKnox, aged 20 at the time of the murder, called the police after returning to her and Kercher's apartment after a night spent with her boyfriend, [[Raffaele Sollecito]], and finding Kercher's bedroom door locked and blood in the bathroom. During the police interrogations that followed, the conduct of which is a matter of dispute, Knox allegedly implicated herself and her employer, Patrick Lumumba, in the murder. Initially, Knox, Sollecito, and Lumumba were all arrested for Kercher's murder, but Lumumba was soon released because he had a strong alibi. A known burglar, [[Rudy Guede]], was soon arrested, after his bloody fingerprints were found on Kercher's possessions. He was convicted of murder in a fast-track trial and was sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment, later reduced to 16 years. In December 2020, an Italian court ruled that Guede could complete his term by doing community service.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55199060|title=Meredith Kercher: Rudy Guede to finish term doing community service|publisher=BBC News |date=December 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn their initial trial, in 2009, Knox and Sollecito were convicted and sentenced to 26 and 25 years in prison, respectively. Pre-trial publicity in Italian media, which was repeated by other media worldwide, portrayed Knox in a negative light, leading to complaints that the prosecution was using character assassination. A guilty verdict at Knox's initial trial and her 26-year sentence caused international controversy, because American forensic experts thought evidence at the crime scene was incompatible with her involvement. A prolonged legal process, including a successful prosecution appeal against her [[acquittal]] at a second-level trial, continued after Knox was freed in 2011. On March 27, 2015, Italy's [[Supreme court|highest court]] definitively exonerated Knox and Sollecito. However, Knox's conviction for committing [[defamation]] against Lumumba was upheld by all courts. On January 14, 2016, Knox was acquitted of defamation for saying she had been struck by policewomen during the interrogation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilmessaggero.it/umbria/i_poliziotti_mi_maltrattata_nuova_assoluzione_amanda_knox-1482506.html|title=Amanda Knox assolta dall'accusa di calunnia: aveva detto di essere stata maltrattata dai poliziotti|publisher=ilmessaggero.it|date=January 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nKnox later became an author, an activist, and a journalist.<ref name=\"Tanenhaus 2013\">{{cite web |last=Tanenhaus |first=Sam |author-link=Sam Tanenhaus |title='Waiting to Be Heard: A Memoir,' by Amanda Knox |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 26, 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/books/review/trial-and-error.html |access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"seattlepi.com 2017\">{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Cohen |title=Amanda Knox mourns Meredith Kercher a decade after murder |newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=November 2, 2017 |ur",

He has also recorded albums as a solo artist, and performed as an actor in musical theatre productions in both the [[West End theatre|West End]] and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].\n\n==Early life==\nPellow's first exposure to music occurred around the age of 7. He would listen to his mother's [[Barras (market)|Barras]]-bought [[8-track tape|8-track]] record collection of [[Burt Bacharach]] and [[Hal David]], but it was the soul genre of the selection that drew him in. Early [[Marvin Gaye]] and, especially, [[Sam Cooke]] captivated him.

That's for me.\"<ref name=memphis>''From Glasgow to Memphis'' documentary</ref>\n\nWhen he told his father about the direction he wanted his life to take, he was less than enthusiastic. \"'Are you on a [[hallucinogenic]] substance or something? What's wrong with getting out there and getting an [[apprenticeship]]? I'm a [[general contractor|builder]], your grandfather was a builder, your great-grandfather was a [[shipbuilder]].

R. R. Tolkien]]'s writings and one of the protagonists<!-- in LOTR he's DEFINITELY not the only one (see [[Heroism in The Lord of the Rings]] for some others), but everyone wants to call him a protagonist, see the history--> in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Frodo is a [[hobbit]] of [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] who inherits the [[One Ring]] from his cousin<!--\"uncle\" is just a friendly name, they are actually both first and second cousins--> [[Bilbo Baggins]], described familiarly as \"uncle\", and undertakes [[Quests in Middle-earth|the quest]] to destroy it in the fires of [[Mount Doom]] in [[Mordor]]. He is mentioned in Tolkien's posthumously published works, ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''.\n\nFrodo is repeatedly wounded during the quest and becomes increasingly burdened by the Ring as it nears Mordor. He changes, too, growing in understanding and compassion, and avoiding violence. On his return to the Shire, he is unable to settle back into ordinary life; two years after the Ring's destruction, he is allowed to take ship to the [[earthly paradise]] of [[Valinor]].\n\nFrodo's name comes from the [[Old English]] name ''[[Froda|Fróda]]'', meaning \"wise by experience\". Commentators have written that he combines courage, selflessness, and fidelity and that as a good<ref name=\"Stanton 223\"/> character, he seems unexciting but grows through his quest, an [[Heroism in The Lord of the Rings|unheroic person who reaches heroic stature]].\n\n==Internal history==\n \t\n[[File:Sketch Map of The Shire.svg|thumb|upright=2.25|Sketch map of [[the Shire]].

At the age of twenty-one, he is adopted by Bilbo, who brings him to live at his home, [[Bag End]] in [[the Shire]]. He and Bilbo share the same birthday, the 22nd of September. Bilbo introduces Frodo to the [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish languages]], and they often go on long walking trips together.<ref name=\"Party\" group=T>{{harvnb|Tolkien|1954a}} book 1, ch. 1, \"A Long-Expected Party\"</ref>\n\n===''The Fellowship of the Ring''===\n\nFrodo comes of age as Bilbo leaves the Shire. Frodo inherits Bag End and [[One Ring|Bilbo's ring]]. [[Gandalf]], uncertain about the origin of the ring, warns Frodo to avoid using it and to keep it secret.<ref name=\"Party\" group=T/> Frodo keeps it hidden for the next seventeen years, and it gives him the same longevity it had given Bilbo. Gandalf [[The Shadow of the Past|returns to tell him]] that it is the One Ring of the Dark Lord [[Sauron]], who is seeking to recover and use it to conquer [[Middle-earth]].<ref group=T>{{harvnb|Tolkien|1954a}} book 1, ch. 2, \"[[The Shadow of the Past]]\"</ref>\n\nRealising that he is a danger to the Shire as long as he remains there, Frodo decides to take the Ring to [[Rivendell]], home of [[Elrond]], a mighty [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]]-lord. He leaves with three companions: his gardener [[Samwise Gamgee]] and his cousins [[Merry Brandybuck]] and [[Pippin Took]]. They are just in time, for Sauron's most powerful servants, the Nine [[Nazgûl]], have entered the Shire as Black Riders, looking for the Ring.
