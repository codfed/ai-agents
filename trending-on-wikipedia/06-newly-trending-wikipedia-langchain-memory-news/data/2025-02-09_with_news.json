Delhi Legislative Assembly is the legislative arm of the [[Government of Delhi]]. At present, it consists of 70 [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|members]], directly elected from [[List of constituencies of the Delhi Legislative Assembly|70 constituencies]]. The tenure of the Legislative Assembly is five years unless dissolved sooner.\n\nThe seat of assembly is the Old Secretariat building, which is also the seat of the [[Government of Delhi]].\n\n==History==\nThe Delhi Legislative Assembly was first constituted on 7 March 1952 under the Government of Part C States Act, 1951; it was inaugurated by Home Minister [[K. N. Katju]]. The Assembly had 48 members, and a Council of Ministers in an advisory role to the Chief Commissioner of Delhi, though it also had powers to make laws. The first Council of Ministers was led by [[Chaudhary Brahm Prakash|Brahm Prakash]], who became the first [[Chief Minister of Delhi]].<ref name=hist/><ref>{{cite web|title=Brahm Prakash: Delhi's first CM, ace parliamentarian |work=Hindustan Times |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/specials/coverage/myindia-myvote/chunk-ht-ui-myindiamyvote-delhi/brahm-prakash-delhi-s-first-cm-ace-parliamentarian/sp-article10-1127703.aspx |date=27 September 2013 |access-date=22 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301071356/http://www.hindustantimes.com/specials/coverage/myindia-myvote/chunk-ht-ui-myindiamyvote-delhi/brahm-prakash-delhi-s-first-cm-ace-parliamentarian/sp-article10-1127703.aspx |archive-date=1 March 2014 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, the [[States Reorganisation Commission]], set up in 1953, led to the Constitutional amendment through [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956]], which came into effect on 1 November 1956. This meant that Delhi was no longer a Part-C State and was made a [[Union Territory]]",

The team compete in [[EFL League One]], the third level of the [[English football league system]].\n\nFounded in 1881 as the Glyn Cricket Club, they began playing football as Orient in 1888 and joined the [[London League (football)|London League]] in 1896 after success in the Clapton & District League. The club adopted the name Clapton Orient two years later and were elected into the [[English Football League|Football League]] in 1905. Relegated out of the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1929, the club adopted the name Leyton Orient after [[World War II]]. They won the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] title in 1955–56 and secured promotion out of the Second Division in 1961–62, though were relegated out of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] after just one season, and suffered a further relegation in 1966. That summer the club's name reverted to Orient F.C. and they went on to win the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] under the stewardship of [[Jimmy Bloomfield]] in 1969–70. Orient spent the 1970s playing in the second tier, winning two [[London Challenge Cup]]s and reaching the 1977 [[Anglo-Scottish Cup]] final and [[1977–78 FA Cup]] semi-finals, before being relegated in 1982 and again in 1985.\n\nIn 1987 the club reverted to being Leyton Orient again. They won promotion out of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] via the play-offs in [[1989 Football League play-offs|1988–89]], though were relegated again in 1995. Orient gained promotion out of [[EFL League Two|League Two]] with [[Martin Ling]] in 2005–06, before Hearn sold the club to Italian businessman [[Francesco Becchetti]], who presided over two relegations in three years under 11 managers, taking the club out of the Football League for the first time in 112 years. [[Nigel Travis]] took over running the club in 2017 and appointed [[Justin Edinburgh]] as manager, and under this stable leadership the club went on to reach the [[2019 FA Trophy final|FA Trophy final]] and win promotion back into the Football League as champions of the [[National League (division)|National League]] in 2018–19. Under manager [[Richie Wellens]], the club was crowned champions of League Two in the [[2022–23 EFL League Two|2022–23]] campaign.\n\nThey are the second oldest football club in London to play at a professional level, and are known to their fans by their nickname \"the O's\". The club's home colours are all red. They have played home matches at [[Brisbane Road]] since 1937, having previously played at [[Clapton Stadium|Millfields]] and [[Lea Bridge Stadium|Lea Bridge Road]].\n\n==History==\n{{See also|List of Leyton Orient F.C. seasons}}\n\n===Formation and name (1881–1914)===\nLeyton Orient were originally formed by members of the Glyn Cricket Club in 1881, many of whom were former students of the [[Independent College, Homerton]] in nearby Hackney (now [[Homerton College, Cambridge|Homerton College]] in [[Cambridge]]); an annual fixture is still held between the club and the college. The team has had several name changes since, first as Eagle Cricket Club in 1886, then as Orient Football Club in 1888.\n\nThe 12 history books written on the club by its historian Neilson N. Kaufman between 1974 and 2015 suggest that the choice of the name ''Orient'' came about at the behest of a player, Jack R Dearing, who was an employee of the [[Orient Steam Nav",
