It was released on [[Netflix]] on December 26, 2024. \n\nThe season stars [[Lee Jung-jae]], [[Lee Byung-hun]], [[Im Si-wan]], [[Kang Ha-neul]], [[Wi Ha-joon]], [[Park Gyu-young]], [[Lee Jin-wook]], [[Park Sung-hoon]], [[Yang Dong-geun]], [[Kang Ae-shim]], and [[Jo Yu-ri]]. It is set three years after [[Seong Gi-hun]] won the Squid Game, giving up on going to the United States and returning to the games with the intent of stopping them once and for all. He once again dives into the mysterious survival game, starting another life-or-death game with new participants gathered to win the prize of {{KRW|45.6|link=yes}}{{nbsp}}billion. A side-plot of the season sees [[Hwang Jun-ho (character)|Hwang Jun-ho]] trying to locate Gi-hun with help from hired mercenaries. \n\nWithin the first three days of release, the second season had 68 million views, exceeding the highest premiere viewership for Netflix held by the first season of ''[[Wednesday (TV series)|Wednesday]]'' at 50.1 million views during its premiere week. According to Netflix, the season ranked at No. 1 in 92 countries. The season garnered positive reviews from critics, though it was generally deemed inferior to the first season. The [[Squid Game season 3|third and final season]], which was filmed back-to-back with the second season, will be released in 2025.\n\n== Episodes ==\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#FF9F80 |overall=5 |season=5 |title=43 |director=14 |writer=17 |airdate=16 |airdateR=<ref name=\"Season2Release\">{{Cite web |last=Porter |first=Rick |date=July 31, 2024 |title='Squid Game' to End With Season 3, Post-Christmas Return Set at Netflix |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/squid-game-season-2-premiere-ending-season-3-1235963660/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241128194715/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/squid-game-season-2-premiere-ending-season-3-1235963660/ |archive-date=November 28, 2024 |access-date=July 31, 2024 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref> |episodes={{Episode list/sublist|Squid Game season 2\n| EpisodeNumber   = 10\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| Title           = Bread and Lottery\n| NativeTitle     = 빵과 복권\n| TranslitTitle   = Ppang-gwa Bokgwon\n|NativeTitleLangCode = ko\n| DirectedBy      = [[Hwang Dong-hyuk]]\n| WrittenBy       = Hwang Dong-hyuk\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2024|12|26}}\n| ShortSummary    = [[Seong Gi-hun]] leaves the terminal{{Efn|As depicted in the [[Squid Game season 1|first season]] episode \"One Lucky Day\".}} determined to confront the Front Man behind the games.

The recruiter abducts Kim and Woo-seok and forces them to play a deadly game of [[rock paper scissors]] minus one combined with [[Russian roulette]], resulting in Kim's death. Jun-ho investigates Gi-hun and locates his operational base. The recruiter confronts Gi-hun there, revealing he was once a soldier in the games who killed his own father, a player, and justifies the games' cruelty by vilifying the participants as scum.

During the conflict, Blahyi led a group of soldiers which fought on the side of the anti-rebel group [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy]] (ULIMO) before [[Conversion to Christianity|converting to Christianity]] and becoming a pastor in 1996.\n\nBorn in the Liberian capital of [[Monrovia]] to a [[Krahn people|Krahn]] family, Blahyi was handed by his father to several tribal elders who initiated him as a [[high priest]] in 1982 at the age of eleven. After Liberian military officer [[Samuel Doe]] staged a [[1980 Liberian coup d'état|coup d'état]] against President [[William Tolbert|William R. Tolbert]] in 1980, the new regime employed Blahyi to perform [[black magic]] rituals at the [[Executive Mansion, Monrovia|presidential palace]] in [[Monrovia]] to help him win the [[1985 Liberian general election|1985 general election]].\n\nIn 1989, [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL) rebel leader [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]] launched a rebellion against Doe's regime, sparking a [[First Liberian Civil War|civil war]]. Blahyi joined ULIMO, a rival militia group, and operated primarily around the Monrovia area. During the conflict, Blahyi and his men, a group of soldiers known as the Naked Base Commandos, fought without clothing and perpetrated numerous atrocities, including [[child sacrifice]] and [[Human cannibalism|cannibalism]].\n\nBlahyi abandoned his life as a warlord and turned to preaching after undergoing a religious conversion in 1996, attributing these actions to receiving a [[Visions of Jesus and Mary|vision of Jesus]]. In 2008, Blahyi testified at the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Liberia)|Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission]], claiming that his victims numbered at least 20,000 individuals. The public testimony brought mixed reactions and led to international attention, leading Blahyi to be featured in several documentaries.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Samuel Kanyon Doe - Liberian.jpg|thumb|140px|Blahyi fought on the side of [[Samuel Doe]] (pictured) during the First Liberian Civil War.]]\n\nJoshua Milton Blahyi was born on 30 September 1971, in [[Monrovia]], [[Liberia]]. He was born into a [[Krahn people|Krahn]] family, some of whom resided in [[Sinoe County]], located in the south of the country; among the Krahn people, belief in [[child sacrifice]] and [[black magic]] was common.{{sfn|Margaritoff|2021}} When he was seven years old, his father granted parental control over him to several Krahn elders, who arranged for Blahyi to be a [[warrior]] and initiated him as a [[high priest]] in 1982, when he was at the age of eleven.{{sfn|Margaritoff|2021}}{{sfn|Paye-Layleh|2008}}\n\nAs Blahyi noted in his memoirs, the role of high priest included overseeing [[human sacrifice]]s.

After receiving the vision, Blahyi would \"give the victim’s last name to its [[Elder (administrative title)|village elders]]\", who would then lead a procession to the sacrifice victim's house, abducting and then sacrificing them atop an [[altar]]; after Blahyi stated an [[invocation]], the victim would then be ritually dismembered.{{sfn|Margaritoff|2021}}\n\nIn 1980, [[Armed Forces of Liberia]] (AFL) master-sergeant [[Samuel Doe]] staged a [[1980 Liberian coup d'état|coup d'état]], overthrowing then-President [[William Tolbert]].{{sfn|Dash|1980}} Blahyi claims that Doe employed him to perform black magic rituals to influence the [[1985 Liberian general election]], although Doe's victory relied more practically on destroying most of the opposition's ballots.{{sfn|Tabor|2016}} Blahyi later explained his support for Doe as being based on a sense of tribal loyalty, because they were both members of the same ethnic group.{{sfn|Paye-Layleh|2008}}\n\n==Wartime actions==\n\nIn 1989, [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]], a rebel leader in the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL), l",
