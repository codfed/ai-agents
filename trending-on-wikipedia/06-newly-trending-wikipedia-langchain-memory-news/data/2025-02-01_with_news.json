He was also the only non-European man to have become European champion. Button is credited as having been the first skater to successfully land the double Axel jump in competition in 1948, as well as the first triple jump of any kind – a triple loop – in 1952. He also invented the flying camel spin, which was originally known as the \"Button camel\". He \"brought increased athleticism\" to figure skating in the years following World War II. According to figure skating historian James R. Hines, Button represented the \"American School\" of figure skating, which was a more athletic style than skaters from Europe.",
