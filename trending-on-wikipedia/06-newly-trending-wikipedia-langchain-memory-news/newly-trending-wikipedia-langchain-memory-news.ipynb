    "# Trending Wikipedia articles with current news context\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we have a good handle articles that trend upon the death of a notable figure. But on Tuesday Jan 14, 2024 we had 5 articles trend\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Aunt Jemima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aunt_Jemima)\n",
    "2. [Josie Totah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josie_Totah)\n",
    "3. [Dendrocnide moroides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrocnide_moroides)\n",
    "4. [Robin Zander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Zander)\n",
    "5. [Zane Gonzalez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zane_Gonzalez)\n",
    "\n",
    "Not a single one of these reasons was correctly identified so it is due time to get up-to-date news tied into this thing!\n",
    "\n",
    "Using [Serper](https://serper.dev/) I submitted a query for recent news pertaining to each article. I then passed this raw output to ChatGPT asking if it could see a reason for it to trend today. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially I saw that the results for dendrocnide moroides were not recent or current. I thought I'd have to iterate on that and pre-filter the results by date. But by passing the entire list of out-of-date articles to chatgpt, it correctly returned a negative result!\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we know that Josie is a former child star who kissed someone on TikTok, Robin Zander performed in a halftime show with his band Cheap Trick during a football game Zane Gonzalez evidently played in.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have absolutely no idea why dendrocnide doroides trended... it's an Australian plant that... surprise surprise... can kill you. There's no current news for this.. not even in my own search so I think I'll have to link social media into this next. \n",
    "\n",
    "Aunt Jemima... I'm not completely sold on why she's trending so far..\n",
    "\n",
    "## Takeaways\n",
    "- Very pleasantly surprised with how well ChatGPT handled a prompt with raw json from the news api\n",
    "- Impressed with ChatGPT's ability to reply with an html structure"
