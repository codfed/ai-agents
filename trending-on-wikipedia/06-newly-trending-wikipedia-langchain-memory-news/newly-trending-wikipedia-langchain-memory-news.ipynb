    "# Trending Wikipedia articles with current news context\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we have a good handle articles that trend upon the death of a notable figure. But on Tuesday Jan 14, 2024 we had 5 articles trend\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Aunt Jemima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aunt_Jemima)\n",
    "2. [Josie Totah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josie_Totah)\n",
    "3. [Dendrocnide moroides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrocnide_moroides)\n",
    "4. [Robin Zander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Zander)\n",
    "5. [Zane Gonzalez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zane_Gonzalez)\n",
    "\n",
    "Not a single one of these reasons was correctly identified so it is due time to get up-to-date news tied into this thing!\n",
    "\n",
    "Using [Serper](https://serper.dev/) I submitted a query for recent news pertaining to each article. I then passed this raw output to ChatGPT asking if it could see a reason for it to trend today. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially I saw that the results for dendrocnide moroides were not recent or current. I thought I'd have to iterate on that and pre-filter the results by date. But by passing the entire list of out-of-date articles to chatgpt, it correctly returned a negative result!\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we know that Josie is a former child star who kissed someone on TikTok, Robin Zander performed in a halftime show with his band Cheap Trick during a football game Zane Gonzalez evidently played in.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have absolutely no idea why dendrocnide doroides trended... it's an Australian plant that... surprise surprise... can kill you. There's no current news for this.. not even in my own search so I think I'll have to link social media into this next. \n",
    "\n",
    "Aunt Jemima... I'm not completely sold on why she's trending so far..\n",
    "\n",
    "## Takeaways\n",
    "- Very pleasantly surprised with how well ChatGPT handled a prompt with raw json from the news api\n",
    "- Impressed with ChatGPT's ability to reply with an html structure"

In December 1974, he asked Buckingham to join Fleetwood Mac, with Buckingham agreeing on the condition that Nicks could also join.

In December 1974, he asked Buckingham to join Fleetwood Mac, with Buckingham agreeing on the condition that Nicks could also join.

Green left the band in May 1970, with McVie's wife [[Christine McVie]] (who had previously contributed to the band as a session musician) joining as an official member on vocals and keyboards two months later.

In December 1974, he asked Buckingham to join Fleetwood Mac, with Buckingham agreeing on the condition that Nicks could also join.

Green named the band by combining the surnames of drummer [[Mick Fleetwood]] and bassist [[John McVie]], who have remained with the band throughout its many line-up changes. Fleetwood Mac have sold more than 120 million records worldwide, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling bands]].\n",

      "Primarily a [[British blues]] band in their early years, Fleetwood Mac achieved a UK number-one single in 1968 with the instrumental \"[[Albatross (instrumental)|Albatross]]\" and had other UK top ten hits with \"[[Man of the World (song)|Man of the World]]\", \"[[Oh Well (song)|Oh Well]]\" (both 1969), and \"[[The Green Manalishi (With the Two Prong Crown)]]\" (1970). Green left the band in May 1970, with McVie's wife [[Christine McVie]] (who had previously contributed to the band as a session musician) joining as an official member on vocals and keyboards two months later. Other key members during the band's early years were [[Jeremy Spencer]], [[Danny Kirwan]], and [[Bob Welch (musician)|Bob Welch]]. By the end of 1974, these members had departed, which left the band without a guitarist and male vocalist. While Fleetwood was scouting studios in Los Angeles, he heard the American [[Folk rock|folk rock]] duo Buckingham Nicks, consisting of guitarist and singer [[Lindsey Buckingham]] and singer [[Stevie Nicks]]. In December 1974, he asked Buckingham to join Fleetwood Mac, with Buckingham agreeing on the condition that Nicks could also join. The addition of Buckingham and Nicks gave the band a more [[pop rock]] sound, and their 1975 album ''[[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|Fleetwood Mac]]'' topped the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart in the United States. Their next album, ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' (1977) reached number one in multiple countries around the world and won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] in 1978.\n",

Green named the band by combining the surnames of drummer [[Mick Fleetwood]] and bassist [[John McVie]], who have remained with the band throughout its many line-up changes. Fleetwood Mac have sold more than 120 million records worldwide, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world\\'s best-selling bands]].\\n\\nPrimarily a [[British blues]] band in their early years, Fleetwood Mac achieved a UK number-one single in 1968 with the instrumental \"[[Albatross (instrumental)|Albatross]]\" and had other UK top ten hits with \"[[Man of the World (song)|Man of the World]]\", \"[[Oh Well (song)|Oh Well]]\" (both 1969), and \"[[The Green Manalishi (With the Two Prong Crown)]]\" (1970). Green left the band in May 1970, with McVie\\'s wife [[Christine McVie]] (who had previously contributed to the band as a session musician) joining as an official member on vocals and keyboards two months later. Other key members during the band\\'s early years were [[Jeremy Spencer]], [[Danny Kirwan]], and [[Bob Welch (musician)|Bob Welch]]. By the end of 1974, these members had departed, which left the band without a guitarist and male vocalist. While Fleetwood was scouting studios in Los Angeles, he heard the American [[Folk rock|folk rock]] duo Buckingham Nicks, consisting of guitarist and singer [[Lindsey Buckingham]] and singer [[Stevie Nicks]]. In December 1974, he asked Buckingham to join Fleetwood Mac, with Buckingham agreeing on the condition that Nicks could also join. The addition of Buckingham and Nicks gave the band a more [[pop rock]] sound, and their 1975 album \\'\\'[[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|Fleetwood Mac]]\\'\\' topped the [[Billboard 200|\\'\\'Billboard\\'\\' 200]] chart in the United States. Their next album, \\'\\'[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]\\'\\' (1977) reached number one in multiple countries around the world and won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] in 1978.\\n\\nThe line-up remained st', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), AIMessage(content='The Fleetwood Mac article is trending on Wikipedia due to the ongoing celebration of their enduring legacy and influence in rock music, particularly following the passing of key member Christine McVie, which has reignited interest in their discography and impact.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), HumanMessage(content='Act as a professional news summarizer.

Green named the band by combining the surnames of drummer [[Mick Fleetwood]] and bassist [[John McVie]], who have remained with the band throughout its many line-up changes. Fleetwood Mac have sold more than 120 million records worldwide, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world\\'s best-selling bands]].\\n\\nPrimarily a [[British blues]] band in their early years, Fleetwood Mac achieved a UK number-one single in 1968 with the instrumental \"[[Albatross (instrumental)|Albatross]]\" and had other UK top ten hits with \"[[Man of the World (song)|Man of the World]]\", \"[[Oh Well (song)|Oh Well]]\" (both 1969), and \"[[The Green Manalishi (With the Two Prong Crown)]]\" (1970). Green left the band in May 1970, with McVie\\'s wife [[Christine McVie]] (who had previously contributed to the band as a session musician) joining as an official member on vocals and keyboards two months later. Other key members during the band\\'s early years were [[Jeremy Spencer]], [[Danny Kirwan]], and [[Bob Welch (musician)|Bob Welch]]. By the end of 1974, these members had departed, which left the band without a guitarist and male vocalist. While Fleetwood was scouting studios in Los Angeles, he heard the American [[Folk rock|folk rock]] duo Buckingham Nicks, consisting of guitarist and singer [[Lindsey Buckingham]] and singer [[Stevie Nicks]]. In December 1974, he asked Buckingham to join Fleetwood Mac, with Buckingham agreeing on the condition that Nicks could also join. The addition of Buckingham and Nicks gave the band a more [[pop rock]] sound, and their 1975 album \\'\\'[[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|Fleetwood Mac]]\\'\\' topped the [[Billboard 200|\\'\\'Billboard\\'\\' 200]] chart in the United States.
