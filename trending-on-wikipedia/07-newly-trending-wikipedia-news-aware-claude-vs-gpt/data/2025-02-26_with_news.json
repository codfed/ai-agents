Several felt they could try their own hand at making video games. To promote their initial ideas, they took advantage of the [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|Redbook audio]] format for compact discs that allowed both audio and digital files to be stored on the same media. Hall left Edmark to start promotion of the company, and ended up with [[Microsoft]], which was preparing for the release of [[Windows 95]]. Microsoft brough on Monolith to develop gaming CDs to demonstrate the capabilities of Windows 95 and [[DirectX]], with the remaining founders quitting Edmark and working out of offices at Microsoft's campus in Redmond, Washington.<ref name=\"gamesradar history\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamesradar.com/from-shogo-to-shadow-of-war-charting-the-chaotic-creative-history-of-monolith-productions/ | title = From Shogo to Shadow of War: Charting the chaotic, creative history of Monolith Productions | first = Robert | last = Zak | date = May 25, 2021 | accessdate = February 27, 2025 | work = [[GamesRadar]] }}</ref>\n\nHall used the gaming CDs to continue to build out a list of contacts for future e",
