        "trending_reason": "Saint Valentine is trending because February 14th marks Valentine's Day, the annual celebration of romantic love that coincides with his feast day in Western Christianity. The historical figure's legacy as a 3rd-century Roman martyr who ministered to persecuted Christians has evolved into a broader cultural symbol of love, while also maintaining religious significance as the patron saint of lovers, epilepsy, and beekeepers.",

Levi Kane, a former [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] and current [[Private military company|private contractor]] accepts the offer to guard the West tower. Drasa, a [[Lithuania|Lithuanian]] covert operative frequently employed by the [[Russia|Kremlin]], agrees to guard the East side.\n\nUpon arriving, Levi relieves his predecessor, J.D., a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Royal Marines|Royal Marine]] of duty and asks for specifics about the mission. J.D. explains that in addition to the towers on the East and West, there are automated turret defenses to the North and South, a powerful signal ‘[[Radar jamming and deception|cloak]],’ and [[Anti-personnel mine|explosives on the walls]] of the gorge to keep the creatures inside contained.

Levi reciprocates and the two engage in a sharpshooting competition that results in a protracted escape attempt from the Hollow Men. After defending their towers and each other, Drasa uses her sign to tell Levi it was her “best birthday ever.” The two start communicating more frequently, sharing messages, playing games of chess, and making improvised drum sets. \n\nSix months into their tour, Levi [[Zip line|ziplines]] to the other side of the gorge to spend time with Drasa. Their date goes well as the two court one another by bringing flowers and making [[Rabbit pie|rabbit pie]]; Levi, an amateur poet, shares some of his work, including the title of a piece he is writing for Drasa, “She Collapsed the Night”. The next day, Levi attempts to cross back to his side of the gorge, but on his way back, the mines on the Western side of the gorge detonate as the Hollow Men climb it, causing him to fall into the gorge as the zipline cable snaps.\n\nDrasa [[BASE jumping|parachutes in]] to rescue him, and the two discover that every plant, animal, and insect within the gorge have been [[Genetic engineering|cross-mutated]] with one another.

        "trending_reason": "Emil Bove is trending because, as a senior DOJ official and former Trump lawyer, he ordered prosecutors to drop corruption charges against NYC Mayor Eric Adams, leading to high-profile resignations including Manhattan's top prosecutor Danielle Sassoon who refused to comply. The controversy is amplified by Bove's past connections to Trump's legal defense team and his involvement in January 6th-related cases, raising questions about potential political motivations in the DOJ's handling of the Adams case.",

The attack killed 40 Indian Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel as well as the perpetrator—Adil Ahmad Dar—who was a local Kashmiri youth from the Pulwama district. The responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Pakistan-based Islamist terrorist group, Jaish-e-Mohammed. India blamed neighbouring Pakistan for the attack, while the latter condemned the attack and denied having any connections to it. The attack dealt a severe blow to India–Pakistan relations, consequently resulting in the 2019 India–Pakistan military standoff. Subsequently, Indian investigations identified 19 accused. By August 2021, the main accused along with six others had been killed, and seven had been arrested.</p>",
