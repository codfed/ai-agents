[[Mike Myers]], [[Eddie Murphy]], and [[Cameron Diaz]] will reprise their respective voice roles as [[Shrek (character)|the title character]], [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]], and [[Princess Fiona]] from the previous films, with [[Zendaya]] joining the cast.\n\nA fifth ''Shrek'' film was initially planned after the release of ''[[Shrek 2]]'' (2004) with a 2013 release date in mind. However, when former DreamWorks CEO [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] decided to end the franchise in its fourth film, plans for a fifth installment were abandoned and ''Shrek Forever After'' was released as the final ''Shrek'' film. Eventually, development resurfaced in 2014 and Universal Pictures officially confirmed production of a fifth ''Shrek'' film when its parent company, [[NBCUniversal]], bought DreamWorks Animation in 2016 with updates following from March 2017 to July 2024.\n\n''Shrek 5'' is scheduled to be theatrically released in the United States on December 23, 2026.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Main|List of Shrek (franchise) characters{{!}}List of ''Shrek'' (franchise) characters}}\n* [[Mike Myers]] as [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]]<ref name=\"SHREK52026-2\" />\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]]<ref name=\"SHREK52026-2\" />\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as [[Princess Fiona]]<ref name=\"SHREK52026-2\" />\n* [[Zendaya]] as Felicia, Shrek and Fiona's daughter<ref name=\"Zendaya\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2025/02/27/zendaya-shrek-5/80719116007/|title=Zendaya will voice Shrek's teenage daughter in 'Shrek 5': Here's what to know|work=USA Today|first=Greta|last=Cross|date=February 27, 2025|access-date=March 1, 2025}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\nAfter the success of ''[[Shrek 2]]'' in May 2004, [[DreamWorks Animation]] (DWA) CEO [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] planned a five-film arc that began with ''[[Shrek]]'' (2001) and would conclude with a fifth installment.<ref name=\"FIRSTPLAN\" /> After the release of ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' in 2007, Katzenberg announced that the fifth film would be released in 2013.<ref name=\"FIRSTANNOUNCE\" />\n\nIn May 2009, DreamWorks announced that the fourth film's title would be ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'', indicating that it would be the last in the ''Shrek'' series.<ref name=\"PLAN-5-2\" /> Later in 2009, that was confirmed by [[Bill Damaschke]], the former head of creative production at DWA, with him saying: \"All that was loved about Shrek in the first film is brought to the final film\".<ref name=\"LATERFINALCONF\" /> [[Josh Klausner]], one of the writers of ''Shrek Forever After'', explained in 2010 the script's evolution: \"When I first came onto the project, it wasn't supposed to be the final chapter — there were originally going to be five ''Shrek'' movies.

It was filmed in [[Jackson's Point]] and [[Port Perry]] in Ontario.\n\n==Plot==\nFormer [[President of the United States]] Monroe \"Eagle\" Cole moves to his vacation home in the town of Mooseport, [[Maine]], to escape from his ex-wife Charlotte. Harold \"Handy\" Harrison is the town's local hardware store owner and plumber. Handy’s job keeps him so busy that he has neglected his relationship with his girlfriend and the town veterinarian Sally Mannis, who is on the verge of [[breakup]].\n\nAfter the mayor dies, the [[town council]] decides to approach former president Cole about running for the office. Cole agrees because, if he is mayor, his Mooseport house can serve as his office and, therefore, can no longer be divided up or sold off in his [[divorce]] settlement. As a surprise to Cole, Handy’s name has also been entered into the race. When Harrison finds out Cole is running, he decides to withdraw, until he witnesses Cole make a pass at Sally. Handy believes that, by becoming mayor, he can show Sally he is a mature decision maker and win back her heart.\n\nTempers rise following the arrival of Cole's ex-wife and campaign spoiler Charlotte. Cole's team, led by long-time executive secretary Grace Sutherland and presidential aide Will Bullard, bring in strong support in the form of campaign strategist Bert Langdon, who is looking for excitement since Cole's retirement. As the campaigns progress, Cole and Handy both become obsessed with winning the race at all costs, although Handy refuses to resort to cheating. Cole realizes that in all his years of campaigning this may be his toughest as he is taking on a genuinely honest [[everyman]].\n\nOn the night before the election, both candidates urge the voters to vote for the other candidate by saying that neither of them will vote for themselves. Handy keeps his promise, but Cole votes for himself. Upon the revelation that Cole won by one vote, his conscience gets the better of him and he concedes the match to Handy. However, Handy lies that he voted for himself as well, and declines office, making Cole end up as mayor. Handy later reveals to Sally that he conceded the election because Cole needs the mayorship more than he does and that all he really wanted was to propose marriage to her, which he does. As Handy is proposing to Sally, Monroe also proposes to Grace. Bert tells Handy that he ran an excellent campaign and offers to be his campaign manager for [[Governor of Maine]], which Handy shows some interest in when he realizes a governor has certain authority over mayors.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Ray Romano]] as Harold \"Handy\" Harrison\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Monroe \"Eagle\" Cole\n* [[Marcia Gay Harden]] as Grace Sutherland\n* [[Maura Tierney]] as Dr. Sally Mannis\n* [[Fred Savage]] as Will Bullard\n* [[Rip Torn]] as Bert Langdon\n* [[Christine Baranski]] as Charlotte Cole\n* [[Wayne Robson]] as Morris Gutman\n* [[Reagan Pasternak]] as Mandy Gutman\n* [[June Squibb]] as Irma\n* [[John Rothman]] as Stu\n* [[Jayne Eastwood]] as Lucy Decker\n* [[Juan \"Chi-Chi\" Rodriguez]] as himself\n* Richard Romano as Handy's bar buddy\n* [[Jon Manfrellotti]] as Reporter\n* [[Edward Herrmann]] (''uncredited'') as Avery Hightower\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn October 2002, it was announced that Romano and [[Dustin Hoffman]] were in negotiations to star in the [[Rod Lurie]] directed comedy ''Mooseport'', and written by [[Tom Schulman]] for [[Intermedia Films]].<ref nam",

It stars [[Gene Hackman]] and [[Willem Dafoe]] as two [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents investigating the disappearance of three civil rights workers in fictional Jessup County, Mississippi, who are met with hostility by the town's residents, local police, and the [[Ku Klux Klan]].\n\nGerolmo began writing the script in 1986 after researching the 1964 murders of [[James Chaney]], [[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Andrew Goodman]] and [[Michael Schwerner]]. He and producer [[Frederick Zollo]] presented it to [[Orion Pictures]], and the studio hired Parker to direct.

Critical reaction was generally positive, with praise aimed towards the cinematography and the performances of Hackman, Dafoe and [[Frances McDormand]]. The film grossed $34.6 million in North America against a production budget of $15 million. It received seven [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and won for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please see WP:FILMPLOT before editing. The plot summary is recommended to be between 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1964, three civil rights workers – two Jewish and one black – go missing while they are in fictional Jessup County, Mississippi (the actual events took place in [[Neshoba County]]), organizing a voter registry for [[African Americans]]. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] sends Alan Ward and Rupert Anderson to investigate. Ward is a Northerner, senior in rank but much younger than Anderson, and approaches the investigation by the book. In contrast, Anderson, a former Mississippi sheriff, is more nuanced in his approach. The pair find it difficult to conduct interviews with the local townspeople, as Sheriff Ray Stuckey and his deputies influence the public and are linked to a branch of the [[Ku Klux Klan]].\n\nWith the help of the son of a local pastor, the FBI is finally able to bring forward a witness who saw Klansmen firebomb a house, and three white men are arrested and tried for felony arson. A local judge, however, gives the men a token suspended sentence while deriding the FBI as \"outside agitators\" who provoked the men to violence. He then releases the men, who promptly hang the witness' father and attempt to kill the witness. The FBI evacuate the family to the north and realize they will receive no help at all from local authorities.\n\nMeanwhile, Anderson has developed a close relationship with the wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell who, in a tearful confession, reveals to Anderson that the three missing men have been murdered by her husband and his Klansmen accomplices, who then buried the bodies in an [[Embankment dam|earthen dam]].
