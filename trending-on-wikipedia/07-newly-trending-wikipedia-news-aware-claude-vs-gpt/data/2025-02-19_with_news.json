In retrospect, Buckler felt that Weller had been given undue credit for the band's song catalogue to the detriment of its other members' contributions.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Buckler briefly reunited with Foxton, and with Jimmy Edwards they performed in a new band called [[Sharp (English band)|Sharp]], recording some new songs for the short-lived Unicorn record label. After Time UK broke up, Buckler moved into production, running a studio in [[Islington]], working on the album ''Bound for Glory'' by [[the Highliners]] (which he also drummed for briefly in 1990). He was also involved in the production of the debut studio album of [[the Family Cat]], ''Tell 'Em We're Surfin'' (1989).\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Buckler abandoned professional music and went into business as an ad hoc carpenter, fashioning cabinets and 'distressed' furniture in Woking, Surrey. In 2005, Buckler re-entered professional music when he set up a new band called the Gift, named after the final [[The Gift (The Jam album)|studio album release]] by the Jam, with Russell Hastings and Dave Moore, with himself on drums, playing exclusively old material from the Jam's back catalogue. In 2007, Foxton joined as the bassist and the new band began touring under the name of [[From the Jam]]. After four years of touring, Buckler quit From the Jam in September 2009, being replaced by [[Mark Brzezicki]] of [[Big Country]].\n\n== Early years ==\nRichard Paul Buckler was born on 6 December 1955 in the town of [[Woking]] in the county of [[Surrey]], England. He received his education at [[Bishop David Brown School|Sheerwater Secondary School]], in Woking. While there in the early 1970s, he joined other pupils [[Paul Weller]] and [[Bruce Foxton]] in a newly formed band named [[the Jam]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wokingnewsandmail.co.uk/?p=365|title=Break-up of The Jam was bitterest pill for Rick Buckler|newspaper=[[Woking News and Mail]]|access-date=10 May 2020}}</ref>\n\n== The Jam ==\n{{Main|The Jam}}\nThe Jam emerged at the same time as [[punk rock]] bands such as [[the Clash]], [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]], and the [[Sex Pistols]].
