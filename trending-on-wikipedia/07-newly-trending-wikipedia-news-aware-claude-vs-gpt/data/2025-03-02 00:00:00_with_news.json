It was the 15th [[WWE Elimination Chamber|Elimination Chamber]] event and took place on Saturday, March 1, 2025, at [[Rogers Centre]] in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. The event aired via [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) and [[livestreaming]] and featured wrestlers from the promotion's [[WWE brand extension|brand divisions]] [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]], [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]], and one wrestler from [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]]. The event is based around the [[Elimination Chamber]] match, a type of multi-person elimination-based [[Steel Cage match]] in which championships or future opportunities at championships are at stake. \n\nThe event comprised four matches, including two Elimination Chamber matches, one each for the men and women. The main event was the men's eponymous match, which was won by [[John Cena]], earning a match for SmackDown's [[Undisputed WWE Championship]] at [[WrestleMania 41]], while the women's match, which was the opening bout, was won by SmackDown's [[Bianca Belair]], earning a match for Raw's [[Women's World Championship (WWE)|Women's World Championship]] at WrestleMania. In another prominent match, Canada native [[Kevin Owens]] defeated fellow Canadian [[Sami Zayn]] in an [[unsanctioned match]]. The event also saw the returns of [[Randy Orton]] and [[Jade Cargill]]. The event was also notable for Cena's final Elimination Chamber appearance due to his retirement from professional wrestling at the end of 2025, as well as his [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel turn]], as Cena had portrayed a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] since 2003.\n\nThis was the first Elimination Chamber event in Toronto and the first WWE event to be held at Rogers Centre since [[WrestleMania X8]] in 2002 when it was still known as the SkyDome. It was also the second Elimination Chamber event in Canada after the [[Elimination Chamber (2023)|2023 edition]] and the fourth consecutive Elimination Chamber to be held outside of the United States. This was also the first PPV to not feature a championship defense since [[Survivor Series (2021)|Survivor Series in 2021]].\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Toronto - ON - Rogers Centre2.jpg|thumb|upright|250px|The 2025 [[WWE Elimination Chamber|Elimination Chamber]] was held at Rogers Centre in Toronto, [[Ontario]], Canada, which was WWE's first event in the stadium since [[WrestleMania X8]] in 2002.]]\n===Background===\n[[WWE Elimination Chamber|Elimination Chamber]] is a [[professional wrestling]] [[List of WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming supercards|event]] first produced by the American promotion WWE in 2010.

        "anthropic_trending_reason": "Tungsten is trending because of its growing economic significance amid potential US tariffs against Canada and Mexico, which is prompting mining companies like American Tungsten to expand domestic supply. Additionally, new research highlighting tungsten heavy alloys' resistance to fusion reactor damage conditions has sparked interest in its applications for advanced energy technologies, while high-grade tungsten discoveries by mining companies such as Guardian Metal's impressive 1.08% grade in Nevada are attracting attention from investors and industrial sectors.",
        "openai_trending_reason": "Tungsten is trending because of increased interest in its mining and production due to domestic supply concerns and potential trade tariffs impacting the market. Recent developments, such as American Tungsten's successful share offering and Guardian Metal Resources' discoveries of high-grade tungsten, highlight its significance in various industries, including materials science and mining.",
