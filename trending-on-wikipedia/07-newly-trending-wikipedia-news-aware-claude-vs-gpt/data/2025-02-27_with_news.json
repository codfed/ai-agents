Originally conceived as the series' primary antagonist, by the final season Georgina came into the good graces of the [[Upper East Side]] - even becoming a member of their inner circle.\n\nShe is notable for her manipulative machinations and sudden returns throughout the series, and for appearing in all the finales, and most recently the latter half of the fifth season in light of cast members [[Taylor Momsen]] and [[Jessica Szohr]] departing. In the sixth season of the show, she appears in eight of ten episodes. Georgina also appears in the second season of the [[Gossip Girl (2021 TV series)|HBO Max sequel series]].\n\n==Novel series==\nGeorgina \"Georgie\" Spark (Sparks in the television series), a wealthy girl and [[New York City]] [[Celebutante]], as well as a drug addict who has blood red lips and long glossy dark hair, meets [[Nate Archibald (Gossip Girl)|Nate Archibald]] in rehab. The two date for a while, and one night, Nate comes over to her mansion. While he is there, Georgina overdoses on various pills, and Nate saves her life by calling their drug counselor. Afterwards, Nate and Georgina go to [[Sun Valley, Idaho|Sun Valley]] for spring break, and Georgie briefly meets [[Serena van der Woodsen]] and [[Blair Waldorf]] (it is hinted that Georgina and Serena previously met in boarding school). Georgina's relationship with Nate ends when she and [[Chuck Bass]] are arrested for having sex on a public highway. She then goes back to rehab, this time in Switzerland. A noticeable difference between her character in the book and television series is that in the book series, Georgina has no cruel intentions towards anyone and never really gets involved with the main characters.\n\n==Television series==\n\n===Casting===\nTim Stack of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' reported that Michelle Trachtenberg took on the role that actress [[Mischa Barton]] had been previously offered.<ref>{{cite web |date=Feb 29, 2008 |author=Lindsay Powers |title=Mischa Barton Turns Down Gossip Girl Role |url=https://www.usmagazine.com/Mischa_Barton_Turns_Down_Gossip_Girl_Role |website=Usmagazine.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302172225/https://www.usmagazine.com/Mischa_Barton_Turns_Down_Gossip_Girl_Role |archive-date=2008-03-02 |quote=She will not be on the show.

Accompanied by his friend Cooper (Pitts) and twin siblings Jenny and Jamie (Trachtenberg and Wester), Scott's quest takes him to England, France, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Germany, and Italy, encountering awkward, humorous, and embarrassing situations along the way.\n\n''EuroTrip'' received mixed reviews from critics and underperformed at the box office. It gained popularity through its home video release and eventually attained a [[cult classic]] status.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the town of [[Hudson, Ohio]], Scott \"Scotty\" Thomas is dumped by his girlfriend, Fiona, immediately following his 2004 high school graduation. With his best friend, Cooper Harris, Scotty attends a graduation party that evening, where the band performs a song (\"[[Scotty Doesn't Know]]\") detailing the affair Fiona was having with the band's singer, Donny (played by Matt Damon). Scotty returns home drunk and angry and reads an email from his [[Germans|German]] [[pen pal]], Mieke—who Scotty calls \"Mike\"—expressing sympathy for Scotty and suggesting they meet in person. Cooper suggests that \"Mike\" may be a sexual predator and Scotty tells Mieke to stay away from him.

She made her debut in the premiere episode of the show's fifth season and subsequently appeared in every episode of its remaining three seasons. Within the series, Dawn is the younger sister of main character [[Buffy Summers]] ([[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]), a girl chosen by fate to be a [[Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|vampire Slayer]]. Whedon introduced Dawn to the series because he wanted to introduce a character with whom Buffy could have an intensely emotional non-romantic relationship.\n\nAfter years of [[foreshadowing]], Dawn was introduced at the start of the fifth season as part of a large in-story [[retroactive continuity|retcon]]: Characters accepted Dawn's presence as if she had always been there, and as if Buffy always had a sister, with only the audience aware that this was not the case. As the series went on, the significance of Dawn's arrival is revealed to the series's other characters, and they come to understand that she has not always been Buffy's sister, or indeed a sentient being; Dawn had originally been the mystical \"key\" to unlocking dimensions and was made into Buffy's sister so the Slayer would protect her. Dawn is, however, a real girl, Buffy's biological sister, and has real memories of her fictional childhood.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sara |first1=Raffel |title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Technology, Mysticism, and the Constructed Body |journal=Studies in Popular Culture |date=2017 |volume=40 |issue=1 |page=36 |jstor=44779942 }}</ref> She struggles in a very human way when she discovers the truth about her origins and later endures problems with [[self-harm]] and [[kleptomania]]. The show's sixth and seventh seasons, as well as its [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] comic book continuation, follow Dawn's journey toward adulthood.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Television===\nDawn Marie Summers is first introduced as Buffy's ([[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]) younger sister at the end of ''Buffy'' season 5 premiere \"[[Buffy vs. Dracula]]\", though Buffy had been previously established as an only child. Initially, the mystery of Dawn's sudden existence is not acknowledged in the series, with the other characters accepting her as a part of the [[status quo]]. Four episodes later, Buffy discovers Dawn is, in fact, a mystical object known as The Key; a group of monks transformed The Key into human form and sent it to the Slayer for protection from the villainous [[Glory (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Glory]] ([[Clare Kramer]]). The memories of Buffy and her associates were altered, along with relevant records, so that they believed her to have always existed as Buffy's sister. She is shown to look up greatly to Willow and Tara and has a crush on Xander. She also is friendly with Spike, who is as protective of her as Buffy herself. When Dawn learns of her origin, she resorts to [[self-harm]] and runs away from home, until Buffy assures her they are real sisters no matter what, securing it with a blood oath. Her relationship with Buffy, having been portrayed with a typical sister dynamic in the first half of the season, changes when she discovers what she is. The two become closer as Dawn becomes Buffy's sole focus once she drops out from college to protect her, going as far as to warn her friends she is prepared to kill anyone who attempts to go near Dawn in the finale.\n\nDawn suffers more pain when [[Joyce Summers|her mother]] ([[Kristine Sutherland]]) dies unexpectedly from a [[brain aneurysm]], which leads to Dawn resorting to [[black magic]] to try to bring her back from the grave, an action she immediately reverses upon realizing the consequences of her actions. It is eventually revealed that Dawn's purpose as The Key is to open portals to alternate dimensions — a power the hell-god Glory wishes to exploit to return home. When Glory successfully uses Dawn's blood to break down the dimensional barriers, Buffy sacrifices her own life (realizing that their blood is now th",

Operated from the nearby [[Alamogordo Army Air Field]] and part of the top secret [[Project Mogul]], the balloon was intended to detect [[Soviet]] [[nuclear tests]].{{efn|name=Mogul}} After metallic and rubber debris were recovered by [[Roswell Army Air Field]] personnel, the United States Army announced their possession of a \"flying disc\". This announcement made international headlines, but was retracted within a day. To obscure the purpose and source of the debris, the army reported that it was a conventional [[weather balloon]].\n\nIn 1978, retired Air Force officer [[Jesse Marcel]] revealed that the army's weather balloon claim had been a cover story, and speculated that the debris was of extraterrestrial origin. Popularized by the 1980 book ''[[The Roswell Incident (1980 book)|The Roswell Incident]]'', this speculation became the basis for long-lasting and increasingly complex and contradictory [[UFO conspiracy theories]], which over time expanded the incident to include governments concealing evidence of extraterrestrial beings, [[grey alien]]s, multiple crashed [[flying saucer]]s, alien corpses and autopsies, and the [[reverse engineering]] of extraterrestrial technology, none of which have any factual basis.\n\nIn the 1990s, the United States Air Force published multiple reports which established that the incident was related to Project Mogul, and not debris from a UFO. Despite this, many UFO proponents still claim that the Roswell debris was in fact derived from an alien craft, and accuse the US government of a cover-up. The conspiracy narrative has become a trope in science fiction literature, film, and television. The town of Roswell promotes itself as a destination for UFO-associated tourism.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==1947 military balloon crash==\n{{Location map+|New Mexico|width=300|float=right\n |marksize=6|mark=Black pog.svg\n |places=\n {{Location map~|New Mexico|lat_dir=N|lat_deg=32|lat_min=51|lon_dir=W|lon_deg=106|lon_min=06|position=top|background=#FFFFFF|label=Alamogordo|marksize=15|mark=Icone Vermelho.svg}}\n {{Location map~|New Mexico|lat_dir=N|lat_deg=34|lat_min=22|lon_dir=W|lon_deg=103|lon_min=19|position=bottom|background=#FFFFFF|label=Clovis|marksize=10|mark=Black pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|New Mexico|lat_dir=N|lat_deg=35|lat_min=02|lon_dir=W|lon_deg=106|lon_min=36|position=top|background=#FFFFFF|label=Kirtland|marksize=10|mark=Black pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|New Mexico|lat_dir=N|lat_deg=32|lat_min=20|lon_dir=W|lon_deg=104|lon_min=15|position=left|background=#FFFFFF|label=Carlsbad|marksize=10|mark=Black pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|New Mexico|lat_dir=N|lat_deg=32|lat_min=15|lon_dir=W|lon_deg=107|lon_min=43|position=left|background=#FFFFFF|label=Deming|marksize=10|mark=Black pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|New Mexico|lat_dir=N|lat_deg=34|lat_min=29|lon_dir=W|lon_deg=104|lon_min=12|position=top|background=#FFFFFF|label=Fort Sumner|marksize=10|mark=Black pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|New Mexico|lat_dir=N|lat_deg=32|lat_min=45|lon_dir=W|lon_deg=103|lon_min=12|position=left|background=#FFFFFF|label=Hobbs|marksize=10|mark=Black pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|New Mexico|lat_dir=N|lat_deg=33|lat_min=18|lon_dir=W|lon_deg=104|lon_min=31|position=bottom|background=#FFFFFF|label=Roswell|mark=Map marker, star.svg|marksize=15}}\n {{Location map~|New Mexico|lat_dir=N|lat_deg=34|lat_min=35|lon_dir=W|lon_deg=105|lon_min=35|position=top|background=#FFFFFF|label=Corona debris|mark=Fire.svg|marksize=10}}\n |alt=Map of New Mexico showing the locations of 8 air fields \n |caption=Roswell was one of many [[New Mexico World War II Army Airfields|Army airf",

It co-stars [[Rosie O'Donnell]], [[J. Smith-Cameron]], [[Gregory Smith (actor)|Gregory Smith]], and [[Vanessa Lee Chester]]. Based on the [[Harriet the Spy|1964 novel of the same name]] by [[Louise Fitzhugh]], the film follows a sixth-grade student who aspires to become a writer and [[spy]].\n\nFilming began in the fall of 1994 in [[Toronto]] and was completed by the end of 1995. Produced by [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Nickelodeon Movies]] and [[Rastar]], it was the first film produced under the Nickelodeon Movies banner and the first of two film adaptations of the ''Harriet the Spy'' books. In theaters, the pilot episode of ''[[Hey Arnold!]]'' called ''Arnold'' was shown before the film.\n\nThe film was released in theaters on July 10, 1996, to mixed reviews from critics. It made $26.6 million worldwide on a production budget of $12 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> The film was released on home video on February 25, 1997.\n\n==Plot==\nEleven-year-old aspiring [[Espionage|spy]] and writer Harriet M. Welsch lives a privileged life in [[New York City]] with her parents, Violetta and Ben, and her nanny, Catherine \"Ole Golly,\" in whom she confides. Harriet and her best friends, Simon \"Sport\" Rocque and Janie Gibbs, are enemies with a [[snob]]by classmate, editor of the [[sixth grade|sixth-grade]] [[Student publication|newspaper]], bully, and [[class president]] Marion Hawthorne.\n\nOne night, as Harriet's parents are out, Golly invites her friend George to dinner, which she burns; the three instead go out for dinner and a movie. Upon returning home late at night, Violetta becomes enraged at Golly for having Harriet stay out past her curfew and fires her. Golly concedes that it is time Harriet was \"on her own.\" Before leaving, Golly encourages Harriet not to give up on her love of \"spying\" and observing people, promising to be the first to buy a signed copy of Harriet's first novel. Depressed and withdrawn, Harriet breaks into the mansion of Agatha Plummer and is caught hiding in her [[dumbwaiter]].\n\nAfter school, Marion discovers Harriet's private spy notebook. She begins reading aloud Harriet's comments about her friends and peers, such as how she suspects Janie will grow up to be \"a total nutcase\" and criticizing Sport's father's low earnings. Sport and Janie shun Harriet, and her classmates create a \"spy-catcher\" club to torment her.\n\nWhen Harriet begins neglecting her schoolwork, her parents confiscate her notebooks and ask her teacher, Miss Elson, to search her for new notebooks daily. During [[Visual arts education|art class]], Marion and company pour blue paint over Harriet as revenge for writing things about them in her notebook. Harriet responds, slapping Marion in the face, and flees from the school. She exacts revenge in several ways: by exposing that Marion's father left their family for his secretary, by cutting off a chunk of Laura's hair, by sabotaging Janie's science experiment, and by humiliating Sport with a picture of him in a maid's outfit. This causes her classmates to alienate her further.\n\nHarriet's parents send her for a psychol",

It stars [[Joan Cusack]], [[Michelle Trachtenberg]], [[Kim Cattrall]] and [[Hayden Panettiere]]. The film focuses on Casey Carlyle, a normal teenager who gives up a promising future academic life in order to pursue her new-found dream of being a professional [[Figure skating|figure skater]]. The film was released on March 18, 2005, to mixed reviews. It underperformed at the box office, grossing $25.7 million during its theatrical run against a production budget of $25 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the city of Millbrook, Connecticut, Casey Carlyle, a very smart and talented science student, pursues a scholarship to [[Harvard University]]. For the scholarship, she must present a personal summer project about physics. While watching a [[figure skating]] competition with her mathematically inclined best friend, Ann, Casey realizes that her favorite childhood hobby, [[ice skating]], would make a perfect project. She decides to try to improve her own skating by applying physics and what she has discovered from watching other skaters.\n\nFollowing a recital, Casey becomes proficient and skips two levels to become a junior skater. She helps fellow junior skaters Gennifer \"Gen\" Harwood, Tiffany Lai, and Nikki Fletcher improve their skating by using [[algorithm]]s generated by her computer. Torn between her Harvard dream and her growing love of skating, Casey has difficulty juggling schoolwork, skating, and a part-time job as a [[concessions]] worker; during this time, she develops a relationship with Gen's brother, Teddy. Her mother, Joan, attempts to prevent her from skating due to her declining academic performance. Meanwhile, tension arises between Joan and Gen's mother, Tina, a disgraced former skater who has since become a coach.\n\nTina, who manages the rink where Casey trains, has Gen on a strict training program. During a competition where both Casey and Gen compete, Tina sees Casey may outrank Gen and sabotages Casey's performance by buying her new skates. Unaware of the danger of unbroken-in skates, Casey's resulting long program is riddled with poor jumps and several falls. Upon being informed of Tina's intent behind her seemingly kind gesture by fellow skate competitor Zoey Bloch, Casey lashes out at her and mistakenly assumes her children were equally involved in the plot. She ranks fifth in the competition but only the top 4 qualify for the [[Figure skating competition#Qualifying competitions in the United States|sectionals]]. As a result, Casey loses interest in skating and returns to her studies and goal of attending Harvard.\n\nUpset at her mother's sabotage and frustrated by all the restrictions of training, Gen quits, inadvertently allowing Casey to take her spot. While Casey and Gen reconcile, Casey can now qualify for the sectionals as Gen quit. She declines the Harvard scholarship competition to devote herself to skating, to Joan's dismay. Casey also reconciles with Tina and asks her to be her personal coach and train for the sectionals. Joan, upset at this change of direction in her life, refuses to watch her skate.\n\nAt the sectionals, Casey is not fully focused on the competition, and falls while attempting a triple [[salchow jump]]. To her surprise, she sees Joan in the audience, having somehow changed her mind. Inspired by this, she gives a highly rated artistic performance. The sectionals ends with Casey placing silver, qualifying to go to Nationals and potentially the [[2006 Winter Olympics]]. Teddy gives Casey flowers to congratulate her, and they kiss. Later, Joan",
