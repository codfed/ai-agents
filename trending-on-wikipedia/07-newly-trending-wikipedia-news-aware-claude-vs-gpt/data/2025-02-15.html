From the High Middle Ages, his feast day has been associated with a tradition of courtly love. He is also a patron saint of Terni, epilepsy, and beekeepers. Saint Valentine was a clergyman – either a priest or a bishop – in the Roman Empire who ministered to persecuted Christians.

The historical figure's legacy as a 3rd-century Roman martyr who ministered to persecuted Christians has evolved into a broader cultural symbol of love, while also maintaining religious significance as the patron saint of lovers, epilepsy, and beekeepers.<br><br>

            Article Extract: <p><b>Eric Leroy Adams</b> is an American politician and former police officer who has served as the 110th mayor of New York City since 2022. Adams was an officer in the New York City Transit Police and then the New York City Police Department (NYPD) for more than 20 years, retiring at the rank of captain. He served in the New York State Senate from 2006 to 2013, representing the 20th district in Brooklyn. In 2013, Adams was elected Brooklyn Borough President, the first Black American to hold the position, and re-elected in 2017.</p><br><br>
            <strong>Reason for Trending:</strong> Eric Adams is trending because the Justice Department moved to dismiss corruption charges against him, triggering the resignation of four deputy mayors and creating a political crisis in New York City. The situation has become so serious that Governor Kathy Hochul is considering removing Adams from office and has called a crisis meeting to discuss the matter, particularly given controversy around Adams' reported cooperation with Trump.<br><br>

            Article Extract: <p>The <b>2019 Pulwama attack</b> occurred on 14 February 2019, when a convoy of vehicles carrying Indian security personnel on the Jammu–Srinagar National Highway was attacked by a vehicle-borne suicide bomber at Lethapora in the Pulwama district of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. The attack killed 40 Indian Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel as well as the perpetrator—Adil Ahmad Dar—who was a local Kashmiri youth from the Pulwama district. The responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Pakistan-based Islamist terrorist group, Jaish-e-Mohammed. India blamed neighbouring Pakistan for the attack, while the latter condemned the attack and denied having any connections to it. The attack dealt a severe blow to India–Pakistan relations, consequently resulting in the 2019 India–Pakistan military standoff. Subsequently, Indian investigations identified 19 accused. By August 2021, the main accused along with six others had been killed, and seven had been arrested.</p><br><br>
