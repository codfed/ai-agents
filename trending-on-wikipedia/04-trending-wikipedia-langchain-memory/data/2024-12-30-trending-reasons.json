It is a remake of the 1922 [[silent film]] ''[[Nosferatu]]'', which was inspired by [[Bram Stoker]]'s 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]''. The film stars [[Bill Skarsgård]] as the titular character, [[Nicholas Hoult]] and [[Lily-Rose Depp]] as the married Hutter couple, with [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]], [[Emma Corrin]], [[Ralph Ineson]], [[Simon McBurney]] and [[Willem Dafoe]] in the supporting roles.\n\nDevelopment on ''Nosferatu'' began in 2015 when Eggers planned to make it his second film, describing it as a passion project, but he eventually opted to delay its production. Skarsgård and Depp were cast as leads in September 2022. Filming took place primarily at [[Barrandov Studios]] in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]] between February and May 2023.\n\n''Nosferatu'' had its world premiere in Berlin, Germany on December 2, 2024, and was theatrically released in the United States by [[Focus Features]] on December 25, 2024, and internationally by [[Universal Pictures]] on January 1, 2025. It has received positive critical reviews.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the winter of 1838, Ellen Hutter lives in the town of Wisborg, Germany, with her husband, Thomas, an estate agent. Hoping to achieve financial security, Thomas accepts a commission from his employer, Herr Knock, to sell Schloss Grünewald, a decrepit stately home in Wisborg, to the reclusive and eccentric Count Orlok. Unknown to Thomas, Knock has arranged this as part of an occult pact with Orlok.\n\nEllen becomes fearful and asks Thomas to stay with her, confessing that, before their wedding, she dreamed she married Death himself, with only corpses in attendance, and found herself enjoying it. He dismisses her fears and departs for Orlok's castle in Transylvania's Carpathian Mountains, leaving her in the care of a wealthy friend, Friedrich Harding and his wife Anna. Upon arriving in Transylvania, Thomas is shunned by the local Romani peasantry for associating with Orlok.
