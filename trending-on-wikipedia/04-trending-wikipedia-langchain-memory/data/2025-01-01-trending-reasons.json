Hoping to achieve financial security, Thomas accepts a commission from his employer, Herr Knock, to sell Schloss Grünewald, a decrepit stately home in Wisborg, to the reclusive and eccentric Count Orlok. Unknown to Thomas, Knock has arranged this as part of an [[occult]] pact with Orlok.\n\nEllen becomes fearful and asks Thomas to stay with her, confessing that, before their wedding, she dreamed she married Death himself, with only corpses in attendance, and found herself enjoying it.
