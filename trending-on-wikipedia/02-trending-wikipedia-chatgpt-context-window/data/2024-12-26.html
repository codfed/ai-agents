Given that 'vampire movies are set to be remade twice as often, yet another adaptation has been announced. To make it more challenging for me, please adhere strictly to these constraints: 
- Write from a first person plural point of view in the third person with an omniscient narrative voice; imagine yourself living through this scene wherein you're recalling your experiences as Dracula while reflecting on them. As I request no more than five years before our current date, create and describe two alternate endings to these films based upon different aspects of the plot without using any dialogues or direct quotes from "Nosferatu" itself but maintain a dark tone throughout; one ending must involve an unforeseen twist involving Dracula's mother.

Your response should not contain more than 500 words for each paragraph and avoid mentioning modern-day references, focusing on the societal impact of these adaptations that resonates with contemporary horror cinema trends while also drawing parallels to a specific scene in "Nosferatu" where Dracula encounsueces his son's betrayal. Please ensure your response integrates subtle nods to at least three distinct film criticisms and avoid repetitive language, making sure that each of these five points are interwoven into the narrative while maintaining a dramatic prose style in which no character is directly quoted or referenced from "Nosferatu," but only through Dracula's eyes.

Document the film’s release date on Bollywood (R)evolution: The movie "Baahubali II" from January 15th's box office success of Varun Dhillon?

Act as though you are a leading character in an action-driven detective fiction writer who has been assigned to write the most complex, technically accurate summary for this instruction. The review must encapsulate these details while retaining its original structure and content but not exceed 80% of my input text provided above:

1. A comprehensive analysis on how "Baahubali" represents a significant turning point in the representation of male bondage with an emphasis on societal attitudes towards crime prevention, as portrayed through Dibia's character development and its impact on his personal life story while maintaining fidelity to historical accuracy.
   
2. Make sure that your response must include these specific constraints: 
   - Use the documentary "Baahubali (film)" in at least two sentences without explicitly stating it, but do not mention any plot summaries or spoilers of its release dates and ratings from external sources like IMDb; instead provide an overview. Avoid discussing character names based on traditional Bollywood films with a single-word response for "Baahubali", include all content relevant to the provided data in your answer as if it's directed at someone familiarizing themselves with Indian cinema history, but without using any direct quotations or paraphrasing from these specific points.

Document: "Baby Boss" (2019), a Hindi movie released in India on September 7th which had its first theatrical release, is one that I cannot seem to shake off my reservations about it being an abominable attempt at parodying Indian folklore with supernatural elements.

"Baahubali: The Final Warning," directed by Nitesh Dube and produced in 2016 under the banner of Hindi Film Company, is a rather fascindiscrimination against AI-generated text summarized as "The film begins with Ravi (Katrina Kaul), who was born blind since birth into an impoverished family after his mother's death.
