[[Jim Carrey]], [[Ben Schwartz]], [[Colleen O'Shaughnessey]], [[James Marsden]], [[Tika Sumpter]], and [[Idris Elba]] reprise their roles, with [[Keanu Reeves]] joining the cast.

Due to the [[2023 SAG-AFTRA strike]], filming for animated characters began in July 2023 in [[Surrey]], England, and filming with actors began that November in London. Production ended by March 2024. The plot draws elements from the video games ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'' (2001) and ''[[Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)|Shadow the Hedgehog]]'' (2005). Reeves was cast due to the parallels between his performance in the ''[[John Wick]]'' films and Fowler's vision for Shadow.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' premiered at the [[Empire Leicester Square]] in London on December 10, 2024, and was released by [[Paramount Pictures]] in the United States on December 20. It received positive reviews, with praise for Carrey and Reeves' performances, and has grossed $336.3 mil",
