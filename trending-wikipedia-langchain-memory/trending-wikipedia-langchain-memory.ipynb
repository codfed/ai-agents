After protracted negotiations and United Nations sanctions, in 1999, [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libyan]] leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] handed over the two men for trial at [[Scottish Court in the Netherlands|Camp Zeist, the Netherlands]]. In 2001, [[Abdelbaset al-Megrahi]], a Libyan intelligence officer, was jailed for life after being found guilty of 270 counts of murder in connection with the bombing. In August 2009, he was [[Release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi|released]] by the [[Scottish Government]] on [[Compassionate release|compassionate grounds]] after being diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]]. He died in May 2012 as the only person to be convicted for the attack.\\n\\nIn 2003, Gaddafi accepted Libya\\'s responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing, and paid over a billion dollars in compensation to the families of the victims, a very unusual outcome for a terrorist bombing. Although Gaddafi  maintained that he had never personally given the order for the attack,<ref name=BBC/> acceptance of Megrahi\\'s status as a government employee was used to connect responsibility by Libya with a series of requirements laid out by a UN resolution for sanctions against Libya to be lifted.<ref>{{Cite web |date=13 August 2003 |title=Libya ready to accept responsibility for Lockerbie bombing |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/libya-ready-to-accept-responsibility-for-lockerbie-bombing-100088.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220524/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/libya-ready-to-accept-responsibility-for-lockerbie-bombing-100088.html |archive-date=24 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |access-date=13 June 2020 |website=The Independent}}</ref> In 2011, during the [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|First Libyan Civil War]], former Minister of Justice [[Mustafa Abdul Jalil]', 'trendingreason': '', 'memorycontext': ''}]\n"

      "Years later in the winter of 1838, Ellen lives in the town of Wisborg, Germany, with her husband, Thomas Hutter, a solicitor and estate agent.

Unbeknownst to Thomas, Knock has arranged this as part of an [[occult]] pact with Orlok.\n",

Murnau]]'s 1922 [[silent film]] ''[[Nosferatu]]'', itself inspired by [[Bram Stoker]]'s 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]''. The film stars [[Bill Skarsgård]] as the titular character and [[Nicholas Hoult]] and [[Lily-Rose Depp]] as the married Hutter couple, with [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]], [[Emma Corrin]], [[Ralph Ineson]], [[Simon McBurney]], and [[Willem Dafoe]] in supporting roles.\n",

Skarsgård and Depp were cast as leads in September 2022. Filming took place primarily at [[Barrandov Studios]] in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]] between February and May 2023.\n",

      "''Nosferatu'' had its world premiere in Berlin, Germany on December 2, 2024, and was theatrically released in the United States by [[Focus Features]] on December 25, 2024, and internationally by [[Universal Pictures]] on January 1, 2025.

      "Under the cover of the night, a young girl named Ellen weeps as she prays, desperately seeking solace from an unseen spirit to ease her deep loneliness. Her plea is answered by a mysterious malevolent entity who attacks her, something Ellen initially finds pleasurable but then leaves her convulsing in a seizure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Years later in the winter of 1838, Ellen lives in the town of Wisborg, Germany, with her husband, Thomas Hutter, a solicitor and estate agent. Hoping to achieve financial security, Thomas accepts a commission from his employer, Herr Knock, to sell Schloss Grünewald, a decrepit stately home in Wisborg, to the reclusive and eccentric Count Orlok. Unbeknownst to Thomas, Knock has arranged this as part of an [[occult]] pact with Orlok.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ellen becomes fearful and asks Thomas to stay with her, confessing that, before their wedding, she dreamed she married Death himself, with only corpses in attendance, and found herself enjoying it. He dismisses her fears and departs for Orlok's castle in Transylvania's [[Carpathian Mountains]], leaving her in the care of a wealthy friend, Friedrich Harding, and his wife Anna.

Murnau]]'s 1922 [[silent film]] ''[[Nosferatu]]'', itself inspired by [[Bram Stoker]]'s 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]''. The film stars [[Bill Skarsgård]] as the titular character and [[Nicholas Hoult]] and [[Lily-Rose Depp]] as the married Hutter couple, with [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]], [[Emma Corrin]], [[Ralph Ineson]], [[Simon McBurney]], and [[Willem Dafoe]] in supporting roles.\n",

Skarsgård and Depp were cast as leads in September 2022. Filming took place primarily at [[Barrandov Studios]] in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]] between February and May 2023.\n",

      "''Nosferatu'' had its world premiere in Berlin, Germany on December 2, 2024, and was theatrically released in the United States by [[Focus Features]] on December 25, 2024, and internationally by [[Universal Pictures]] on January 1, 2025.

      "Under the cover of the night, a young girl named Ellen weeps as she prays, desperately seeking solace from an unseen spirit to ease her deep loneliness. Her plea is answered by a mysterious malevolent entity who attacks her, something Ellen initially finds pleasurable but then leaves her convulsing in a seizure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Years later in the winter of 1838, Ellen lives in the town of Wisborg, Germany, with her husband, Thomas Hutter, a solicitor and estate agent. Hoping to achieve financial security, Thomas accepts a commission from his employer, Herr Knock, to sell Schloss Grünewald, a decrepit stately home in Wisborg, to the reclusive and eccentric Count Orlok. Unbeknownst to Thomas, Knock has arranged this as part of an [[occult]] pact with Orlok.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ellen becomes fearful and asks Thomas to stay with her, confessing that, before their wedding, she dreamed she married Death himself, with only corpses in attendance, and found herself enjoying it. He dismisses her fears and departs for Orlok's castle in Transylvania's [[Carpathian Mountains]], leaving her in the care of a wealthy friend, Friedrich Harding, and his wife Anna.
