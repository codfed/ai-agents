He dismisses her fears and departs for Orlok's castle in Transylvania's [[Carpathian Mountains]], leaving her in the care of a wealthy friend, Friedrich Harding, and his wife Anna and their young daughters.

Ellen becomes fearful and asks Thomas to stay with her, confessing that before their wedding, she dreamed she married Death himself, with only corpses in attendance, and found herself enjoying it. He dismisses her fears and departs for Orlok's castle in Transylvania's [[Carpathian Mountains]], leaving her in the care of a wealthy friend, Friedrich Harding, and his wife Anna and their young daughters.
